Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Rat
- Human
- Lower Animals

---
#### **Rat**
- Also has Immunodeficient, Immunocompetent & Genetically Engineered models

**Comparison between Rat and Mouse models**
- Rat has larger size
	- Easier surgical treatment
	- Better pharmacokinetic & metabolic properties


#### **Human**
- Ex vivo tumor slice cultures
	- Used in cancer research & drug testing


#### **Lower Animals**
- Caenorhabditis Elegans
- Drosophila Melanogaster (Fruit Fly)
- Zebrafish

**Relevancy of Lower Animals in Cancer**
- Similarity to Human Genome
	- Homologs of Human Gene Identified
		- C. Elegans: 60-80%
		- Fruit Fly: 60% (Disease Causing: 75%)
		- Zebrafish: 70% (Disease Causing: 84%)
	- Conserved Basic Pathways
		- e.g. JAK-STAT
- Rapid Life Cycle
	- Short mature time
- Low Manipulation Difficulty
	- Fully Sequenced Genome

**Drawbacks of Lower Animals in Cancer**
- Different Optimal Temperature
	- 28Â°C
- Different Microenvironment
- Potentially Long & Lower Tumor Onset
