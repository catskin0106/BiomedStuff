---
#### **Cancer Models**
- Simplified representation of a complex system
	- for Hypothesis Testing before Conducting Human Trials

**Criteria for Good Cancer Models**
- Contains components relevant to the hypothesis
- Not too complicated for facilitating understanding


#### **Cell-Free Models**
- Molecular Targets of Drugs
	- E.g. Tyrosine Kinase:

| Step | Description                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | ATP consumed by Extracellular Kinase             |
| 2    | Remaining ATP used by Luciferin to produce light |
| 3    | Measure brightness to determine Kinase ATP usage |

**Applications of Cell-Free Models**
- Drug Discovery & Optimization
	- e.g. Vemurafenib for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> Late-Stage Melanoma
- Cell-Free Screening of Molecular Targets

**Advantages of Cell-Free Models**
- Cheap
- Automated
- High Throughput


#### **Cancer Cell Lines**
**Applications of Cell-Free Models**
- Observe Cell Growth, Migration & Invasion
	- e.g. <abbr Title="Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition">EMT</abbr>
- Testing / Modeling Cellular Resistance to Drug

**Advantages of Cancer Cell Lines**
- Easily genetically manipulated
	- Through Lipid Transfection & Viral Transduction
	- Achieve Gene <abbr Title="Insertion of Exogenous Gene">Knockin</abbr> & <abbr Title="Inactivation / Deletion of Gene">Knockout</abbr>
- Easily reproduced, cultured & expanded
- Homogenous
- Well-developed assay tools & collection method
