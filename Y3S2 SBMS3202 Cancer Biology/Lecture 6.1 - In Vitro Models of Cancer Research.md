Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Cancer Models
- Cell-Free Models
- Cancer Cell Lines
- 3D Spheroid Culture

---
#### **Cancer Models**
- Simplified representation of a complex system
	- for Hypothesis Testing before Conducting Human Trials

**Criteria for Good Cancer Models**
- Contains components relevant to the hypothesis
- Not too complicated for facilitating understanding


#### **Cell-Free Models**
- Molecular Targets of Drugs
	- E.g. Tyrosine Kinase:

| Step | Description                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | ATP consumed by Extracellular Kinase             |
| 2    | Remaining ATP used by Luciferin to produce light |
| 3    | Measure brightness to determine Kinase ATP usage |

- Applications:
	- Drug Discovery & Optimization
		- e.g. Vemurafenib for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> Late-Stage Melanoma
	- Cell-Free Screening of Molecular Targets

**Advantages of Cell-Free Models**
- Cheap
- Automated
- High Throughput


#### **Cancer Cell Lines**
