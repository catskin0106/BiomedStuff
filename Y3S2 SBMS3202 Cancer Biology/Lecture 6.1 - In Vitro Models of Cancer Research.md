#### **Cancer Models**
- Simplified representation of a complex system
	- for Hypothesis Testing before Conducting Human Trials

**Criteria for Good Cancer Models**
- Contains components relevant to the hypothesis
- Not too complicated for facilitating understanding


#### **Cell-Free Models**
- Molecular Targets of Drugs
	- E.g. Tyrosine Kinase:

| Step | Description                                      |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 1    | ATP consumed by Extracellular Kinase             |
| 2    | Remaining ATP used by Luciferin to produce light |
| 3    | Measure brightness to determine Kinase ATP usage |

**Applications of Cell-Free Models**
- Drug Discovery & Optimization
	- e.g. Vemurafenib for BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> Late-Stage Melanoma
- Cell-Free Screening of Molecular Targets

**Advantages of Cell-Free Models**
- Cheap
- Automated
- High Throughput


#### **Cancer Cell Lines**
**Applications of Cell-Free Models**
- Observe Cell Growth, Migration & Invasion
	- e.g. <abbr Title="Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition">EMT</abbr>
- Testing / Modeling Cellular Resistance to Drug

**Advantages of Cancer Cell Lines**
- Easily genetically manipulated
	- Through Lipid Transfection & Viral Transduction
	- Achieve Gene <abbr Title="Insertion of Exogenous Gene">Knockin</abbr> & <abbr Title="Inactivation / Deletion of Gene">Knockout</abbr>
- Easily reproduced, cultured & expanded
- Homogenous
- Well-developed assay tools & collection method

**Disadvantages of Cancer Cell Line**
- Culture Conditions deviate from physiological conditions
	- Nutrient, O<sub>2</sub> & Drug Accessibility
	- Mechanical Stress
- Multi-clonal → Heterogenous
- Lack other cells in tumor microenvironment
	- Immune Cells
	- Fibroblasts (Production of Tumor Promoting Factor)
	- Endothelial Cells (Angiogenesis)
- Genetic Drift & Contamination

**Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia Project**
- Online Portal for:
	- Gene dependency, expression & mutation
	- Gene copy number
	- Drug activity
- Basis of CRISPR-Cas9 Knockout Screening
	- Use CRISPR-Cas9 to Knockout Genes to observe their importance for cellular function


#### **3D Spheroid Culture**
- Mimics 3D Tumor Structure & Microenvironment

**Components of 3D Spheroid Culture**

| Component           | Function                                                       |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Matrigel            | Matrix Scaffold<br>Allows Self-renewal & Differentiation       |
| Tumor Organoids<br> | Derived from Patients → maintain primary tumor characteristics |
| Engineered          |                                                                |
