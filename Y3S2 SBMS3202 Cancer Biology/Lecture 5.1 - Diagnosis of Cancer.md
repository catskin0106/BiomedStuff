- Laboratory Tests
- Imaging Tests
- Biopsy Tests
- Molecular Diagnostics

#### **Cancer Diagnosis**
**Advantages & Disadvantages of Early Diagnosis**
- Advantages:
	- ↑ Survival Rate & QoL
	- ↓ Treatment Morbidity
- Disadvantages:
	- May lead to Over-Diagnosis
	- Physical & Emotional Harm
		- ∵ Invasive Treatment
	- Cost

**Procedures of Cancer Diagnosis**
- Physical Exam & Consultation → Laboratory Tests → Imaging Tests → Biopsy


#### **Laboratory Tests**
- Detection of Biomarkers
	- Biomolecules produced by / due to tumor
		- Tumor-Specific Markers: Only present in Individual Tumor Types
		- Tumor-Associated Markers: Elevated in Tumor Presence
	- Can be quantitative / qualitatively measured to detect tumor presence
		- In Cell / Tissue / Body Fluid

**Biomolecules as Tumor Biomarkers**
