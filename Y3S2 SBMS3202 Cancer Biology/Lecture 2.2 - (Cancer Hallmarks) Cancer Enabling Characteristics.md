---
#### **Definition of Cancer Enabling Characteristics**
- Molecular & Cellular Mechanisms by which Hallmarks are acquired


#### **2 Enabling Characteristics**
**1. Genomic Instability**
- Multistep tumor progression
	- Successive clonal expansions triggered by mutant genotype with selective advantage
- Mutability achieved through:
	- Compromise of Surveillance Systems (e.g. p53)
	- Breakdown of Genomic Maintenance Machinery that Prevent, Detect, Initiate & Repair DNA damage
		- Prevent: Inactivate mutagenic molecules
		- Initiate: Activates DNA repair machinery


**2. Tumor-Promoting Inflammation**
- Infiltration of lymphocytes leading to conditions similar to inflammation
	- Enhances tumorigenesis & progression by supplying bioactive molecules
