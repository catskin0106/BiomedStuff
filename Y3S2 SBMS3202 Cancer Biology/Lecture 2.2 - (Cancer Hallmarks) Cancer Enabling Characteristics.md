#### **Definition of Cancer Enabling Characteristics**
- Molecular & Cellular Mechanisms by which Hallmarks are acquired


#### **2 Enabling Characteristics**
**1. Genomic Instability**
- Multistep tumor progression
	- Successive clonal expansions triggered by mutant genotype with selective advantage
- Mutability achieved through:
	- Compromise of Surveillance Systems (e.g. p53)
	- Breakdown of Genomic Maintenance Machinery that Prevent, Detect, Initiate & Repair DNA damage
		- Prevent: Inactivate mutagenic molecules
		- Initiate: Activates DNA repair machinery


**2. Tumor-Promoting Inflammation**
- Infiltration of lymphocytes leading to conditions similar to inflammation
	- Enhances tumorigenesis & progression by supplying bioactive molecules:
		- Survival, Growth & Proangiogenic factors
		- ECM-Modifying enzymes for angiogenesis, invasion & metastasis
		- Mutagenic <abbr Title="Reactive Oxygen Species">ROS</abbr>
		- Inductive EMT Signals


#### **2 Emerging Enabling Characteristics**
**3. Non-mutational Epigenetic Reprogramming**
- Purely epigenetically-regulated changes in gene expression
- Contributes to Dynamic Transcriptomic Heterogenicity
	- Variability of Gene Expression Levels among cells in a population


**4. Polymorphic Microbiomes**
- Diversity & Variability of Microbiota in the epidermis / internal mucosa
- Microorganisms / Microbiota can have protective / deleterious effects on tumor development
