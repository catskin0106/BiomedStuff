Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Oncogene Addiction

---
#### **Oncogene Addiction**
**Oncogene Actions**
- Increased:
	- Growth Factor Products / Receptors
	- Cell Cycle Components (e.g. Cyclins & CDKs)
- Mutant:
	- Signal Transducer
	- Transcription Factors

**Oncogene Addiction**
- Tumor maintenance highly dependent on continued activity of specific & constitutively activated oncogenes
- Resultant Oncoproteins can be targets for target therapies if criteria are met:
	- Recurrent: Consistently contributing to certain cancer types
	- Druggable
- Examples of cancer types with oncogene addiction:

| Cancer Type | Mutation | Oncogene |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- |
|             |          |          |
