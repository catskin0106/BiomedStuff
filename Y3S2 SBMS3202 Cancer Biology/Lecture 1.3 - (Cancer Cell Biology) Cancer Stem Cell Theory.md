#### **Normal & Cancer Stem Cells**
**Types of Normal Stem Cells**
- Somatic Stem Cells
	- Can differentiate into specialized cell types in organ of origin / other organs
- Pluripotent Stem Cells
	- Can differentiate into almost all cell types
- Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
	- Can differentiate into all <abbr Title="Ectoderm, Mesoderm, Endoderm">3 germ layers</abbr>
	- Obtained from reprogramming with <abbr Title="Transcriptional Factors">TF</abbr>s in skin fibroblasts

#### **Cancer Stem Cell Theory**
**Models of CSC Hierarchy**
- Classical (<abbr Title="Differentiated Cells can't be converted to CSC">Unidirectional Conversion</abbr>): Tumor Growth Ability limited to small subpopulation
- Plasticity (<abbr Title="Some Differentiated Cells can be converted to CSC">Bidirectional Conversion</abbr>): Different Cellular States can Interconvert
	- e.g. EMT-responsive differentiated cells can form CSCs
- Updated (<abbr Title="Immediate Microenvironment of Cell">Niche</abbr>-dependent): Niche <abbr Title="Non-epithelial Stromal Cells / Inflammatory Cells / Vasculature">key components</abbr> release niche signals to determine cell fate
	- CSC fates:
		- Self-renewal & Proliferation Signal → Maintain undifferentiated state
		- Leaving the niche → Differentiation
	- Non-self renewing transient amplifying cell & Differentiated cell fates:
		- Niche Signal → Differentiation
		- Niche Signal → Form CSCs

**Experimental Evidences**
