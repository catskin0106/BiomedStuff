#### **Cancer Stem Cell Theory**
**Models of CSC Hierarchy**
- Classical (<abbr Title="Differentiated Cells can't be converted to CSC">Unidirectional Conversion</abbr>): Tumor Growth Ability limited to small subpopulation
- Plasticity (<abbr Title="Some Differentiated Cells can be converted to CSC">Bidirectional Conversion</abbr>): Different Cellular States can Interconvert
	- e.g. EMT-responsive differentiated cells can form CSCs
- Updated (<abbr Title="Immediate Microenvironment of Cell">Niche</abbr>-dependent): Niche <abbr Title="Non-epithelial Stromal Cells / Inflammatory Cells / Vasculature">key components</abbr> release niche signals to determine cell fate
	- Fates of CSCs:
		- Self-renewal & Proliferation Signal → Maintain undifferentiated state
		- Leaving the niche → Differentiation
	- Fates of Differentiated cells & Non-self renewing transient amplifying cells:
		- Niche Signal → Differentiation
		- Niche Signal → Form CSCs

**Experimental Evidences**
- Xenotransplantation of different cancer cell types into mouse
	- Only a small subset of cells have tumor initiating properties (CSCs)
- Isolation of CSCs through surface markers
	- e.g. CD24, 44, 133


#### **Relevance to Cancer Treatment**
**Cancer Therapy Resistance in CSCs**
- Resistance to Radiotherapy & Conventional Chemotherapy
	- ↑ <abbr Title="ATP-Binding Casette">ABC</abbr> Transporters → ↑ Toxin & Anticancer Drug Efflux from cell → Multiple Drug Resistance
- Relapse Tumors & Distant Metastasis
	- CSC-Niche Interaction
		- Microenvironment stimuli give rise to new CSCs from differentiated tumor cells after chemotherapy
	- CSCs are potentially resistant / metastatic

**Cancer Therapy Targeting CSCs**
- Targeting CSCs
	- Surface Markers
	- ABC Transporters
	- Metabolic & Signaling Pathways
- Targeting Tumor Microenvironment

**Hurdles in Development Cancer Therapy Targeting CSCs**
- Poor identification of CSC characteristics in certain tumor types
- Poor representation of cancer complexity in current models
	- Isolated CSCs in studies did not account for CSC-niche Interactions
- Poor understanding of CSC niche
	- e.g. <abbr Title="Tumor-Associated Macrophages">TAMs</abbr> & <abbr Title="Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts">CAFs</abbr> Interaction with CSCs
- Common pathways shared by CSCs & Normal Stem Cells
