#### **Normal & Cancer Stem Cells**
**Types of Normal Stem Cells**
- Somatic Stem Cells
	- Can differentiate into specialized cell types in organ of origin / other organs
- Pluripotent Stem Cells
	- Can differentiate into almost all cell types
- Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells
	- Can differentiate into all <abbr Title="Ectoderm, Mesoderm, Endoderm">3 germ layers</abbr>
	- Obtained from reprogramming with <abbr Title="Transcriptional Factors">TF</abbr>s in skin fibroblasts
