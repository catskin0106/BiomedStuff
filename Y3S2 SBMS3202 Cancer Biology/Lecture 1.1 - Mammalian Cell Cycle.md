**Cell Cycle Checkpoints**
- Tightly regulated by Internal & External factors
	- Progression Factors: Growth Factors, Nutrients & Mitogens
	- Arrest Factors: DNA Damage, <abbr Title="Cell-cell contract / Cell Differentiation">Cell type</abbr>, Anti-mitogenic Factors
- Prevent accumulation of genetic errors during mitosis

#### **Key Cell Cycle Regulatory Genes**
**Cell Cycle Regulatory Components**
- Combination of Cyclin & <abbr Title="Cyclin-dependent Kinase">CDK</abbr>
	- Give go-ahead / apoptosis / DNA repair signals to cells
