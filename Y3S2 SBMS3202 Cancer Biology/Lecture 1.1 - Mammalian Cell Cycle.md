#### **Key Cell Cycle Regulatory Genes**
**Cell Cycle Regulatory Components**
- Combination of Cyclin (A-D) & <abbr Title="Cyclin-dependent Kinase">CDK (1-6)</abbr>
	- Give go-ahead / apoptosis / DNA repair signals to cells in cell cycle checkpoints
	- Prevent accumulation of genetic errors during mitosis

#### **Cell Cycle Genes in Human Cancer**
**Molecular Basis of Cancer**
- Genetic Disease
	- Multiple cellular-level genetic changes
	- Alters normal control mechanisms of cell physiology
- Tumors from Monoclonal Proliferation
	- All tumor cells originates from 1 single Ancestral Cell
- Accumulation of Non-lethal Damage / Mutation
	- Passed onto somatic daughter cells
	- Neoplastic Transformation is a Progressive Process
