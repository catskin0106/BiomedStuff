#### **Cancer Prevention**
**Cancer Prevention Strategies / Directions**
- Prevention
	- Design Effective Preventive Strategies
	- Recognize cancer predispositions
	- Detect precursor lesions / molecular tissue changes
- Target
	- ↑ Treatment Specificity / Therapeutic Margin
	- Delineate Heterogenous Pathogenesis
- Safety
	- Protect Patients from Treatment Adverse Effects

**Modalities for Prevention**
- Behavioral
	- Nutritional
	- Carcinogen Exposure
- Hormonal
- Pharmalogical (Chemoprevention)
- Immunological (Vaccination)


#### **Chemoprevention**
- ↓ Carcinogen Impact → Treat Precancers / Mitigate Precancer Risk

**Aspirin**
- NSAID → ↓ [[Lecture 8.1 - Pain & Analgesics|PG Synthesis by COX]] → ↓ Inflammation from Multiple signaling pathways
	- Affects Cancer cells, Immune cells, Stromal cells
