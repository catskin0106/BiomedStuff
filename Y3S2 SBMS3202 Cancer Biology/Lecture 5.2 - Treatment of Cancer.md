#### **Factors Affecting Treatment Decisions**
**Necessity of Treatment**

| Tumor Type | Invasiveness & Metastasis Potential |
| :--------: | ----------------------------------- |
|  Indolent  | Low                                 |
| Low-Grade  | Medium (Can be removed)             |
| High-Grade | High                                |

**Method of Treatment**
- Cancer Staging
	- Stage 0/I/II: Local Invasion
	- Stage III: Lymph / Neighboring Tissue Invasion
	- Stage IV: Distant Metastasis
- Histological Diagnosis
	- Tumor Subtype
	- Tumor Differentiation
	- Tumor Aggressiveness (Primary / Recurrent / Metastatic)
- Tumor-related Mutations
- Tumor Microenvironment
	- Hot: High T-Cell Infiltration → Inflammation
	- Cold: Low T-Cell Infiltration → Hard to treat with immunotherapy


#### **Surgery**
- Resection
	- Primary Tumors exhibiting local invasion
	- Neighboring Tissues & Lymph Nodes

**Types of Surgery**

|     Surgery Type     | Description                                         |
| :------------------: | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Preventative Surgery | Colon Polyp Removcal                                |
|  Diagnostic Surgery  | Biopsy for Cancer Staging / Lab Tests               |
|   Curative Surgery   | Complete Tumor Removal (Sometimes with Lymph Nodes) |
|  Palliative Surgery  | Surgery to Relieve Discomfort only                  |


#### **Radiotherapy**
- Radiation → cancer cell DNA damage
	- → DNA Repair Mechanism Activation → Cell Cycle Arrest
	- → Double Strand break → Genomic Instability & Apoptosis

**Radiation Sources**

| Radiation Sources | Effectiveness | Precision |   Cost    | Availability |
| :---------------: | :-----------: | :-------: | :-------: | :----------: |
|       X-Ray       |      Low      |    Low    |    Low    |     High     |
|      Proton       |      Low      |   High    |   High    |     Low      |
|    Carbon Ions    |     High      |   High    | Very High |   Very Low   |
