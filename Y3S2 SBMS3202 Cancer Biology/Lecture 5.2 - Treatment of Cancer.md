#### **Factors Affecting Treatment Decisions**
**Necessity of Treatment**

| Tumor Type | Invasiveness & Metastasis Potential |
| :--------: | ----------------------------------- |
|  Indolent  | Low                                 |
| Low-Grade  | Medium (Can be removed)             |
| High-Grade | High                                |

**Method of Treatment**
- Cancer Staging
	- Stage 0/I/II: Local Invasion
	- Stage III: Lymph / Neighboring Tissue Invasion
	- Stage IV: Distant Metastasis
- Histological Diagnosis
	- Tumor Subtype
	- Tumor Differentiation
	- Tumor Aggressiveness (Primary / Recurrent / Metastatic)
- Tumor-related Mutations
- Tumor Microenvironment
	- Hot: High T-Cell Infiltration → Inflammation
	- Cold: Low T-Cell Infiltration → Hard to treat with immunotherapy


#### **Surgery**
- Resection
	- Primary Tumors exhibiting local invasion
	- Neighboring Tissues & Lymph Nodes
