#### **Definition of Cancer Hallmarks**
- Set of Functional Capabilities acquired as human cells transforms from normalcy to malignant neoplastic growth states
	- Genetic & epigenetic alterations that corrupt latent but activatable normal cell capabilities


#### **First Six Hallmark Capabilities**
**Sustain Proliferative Signaling**
- Ways to sustain proliferative signaling:
	- Autocrine stimulation
		- Cancer cell self-produce GF ligands
	- Paracrine stimulation
		- Tumor-associated stroma supply GFs upon cancer cell signal
	- Dysregulated receptor signaling:
		- Elevated surface protein levels
		- Structural alterations → Enable firing without ligand
	- Growth Factor Independence: 
		- Activation of downstream components of cognate receptor → Enable activation without ligand & firing

**Evading Growth Suppression**
- Evade prototypical tumor suppressor genes:
	-
