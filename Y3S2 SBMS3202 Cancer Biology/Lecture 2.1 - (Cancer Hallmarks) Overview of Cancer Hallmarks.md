#### **Definition of Cancer Hallmarks**
- Set of Functional Capabilities acquired as human cells transforms from normalcy to malignant neoplastic growth states
	- Genetic & epigenetic alterations that corrupt latent but activatable normal cell capabilities


#### **First Six Hallmark Capabilities**
**Sustain Proliferative Signaling**
- Ways to sustain proliferative signaling:
	- Autocrine stimulation
		- Cancer cell self-produce GF ligands
	- Paracrine stimulation
		- Tumor-associated stroma supply GFs upon cancer cell signal
	- Dysregulated receptor signaling:
		- Elevated surface protein levels
		- Structural alterations → Enable firing without ligand
	- Growth Factor Independence: 
		- Activation of downstream components of cognate receptor → Enable activation without ligand & firing

**Evading Growth Suppression**
- Evade 2 prototypical tumor suppressor genes:
	- <abbr Title="Retinoblastoma-Associated">RB</abbr> & TP53: Central control nodes for 2 complementary cellular regulatory circuits

| Protein | Activation Signal                          | Function                                                                                            |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RB      | Extracellular Integrated & Diverse Signals | Checkpoint in cell cycle ([[Lecture 1.1 - (Cancer Cell Biology) Mammalian Cell Cycle\|G1-S Phase]]) |
| TP53    | Intracellular Stress & Abnormality         | Repairable: Cell Senescence<br>Unrepairable: Apoptosis                                              |

**Replicative Immortality**
- Upregulated Telomerase Expression & Activation on Telomere
	- Telomere: Multiple tandem hexanucleotide repeats
		- As a cellular "Doomsday Clock"
		- Triggers senescence / apoptosis once length is insufficient
	- Telomerase: Specialized DNA polymerase
		- Adds telomere repeat segments to telomere end → Delays "Doomsday"

**Resisting Cell Death**
- Circumventing apoptosis from stress due to ↑ Oncogene Signaling & DNA damage by:
	- ↑ Anti-apoptotic regulator expression
	- ↓ Pro-apoptotic factor expression
	- ↓ TP53
	- Short-circuiting Extrinsic Ligand-induced Death Pathway

**Inducing Angiogenesis**
- Aberrant tumor neovasculature providing nutrient & O2 while evacuating waste & CO2
	- Erratic Blood Flow, Microhemorrhage & Leakiness
	- Excessive Branching
	- Distorted & Enlarged vessels
- <abbr Title="Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor">VEGF</abbr> & <abbr Title="Angiopoietin 2">ANG2</abbr>: Key drug targets for normalizing tumor vasculature & oxygen level
	- Regression of blood vessels → Starve tumors of essential metabolites
	- Adequate O2 level → Enable drug & immune system action

**Activating Invasion & Metastasis**
- Alters shape in their attachment to other cells & ECM through <abbr Title="Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition">EMT</abbr>
	- ↓ E-Cadherin → Disrupt cell sheet & Potentiates invasion & metastasis
	- ↑ N-Cadherin → Cell migration for metastasis
- Events in EMT:

| Event          | Description                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transcription  | EMT Orchestrated by a set of TFs (e.g. Snail, Slug, Twist) |
| Local Invasion |                                                            |
| Intravasation  |                                                            |
