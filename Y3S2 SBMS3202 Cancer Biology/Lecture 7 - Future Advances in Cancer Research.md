**Lecture Coverage:**
- cfDNA in Early Detection
- Synthetic Biosensors in Early Detection
- 3D Mapping of Tumors
- Immunotherapy

---
#### **cfDNA in Early Detection**
- Tumor shed fragmented carcinogenic cfDNA into bloodstream
	- ↑ cfDNA in Cancer Patients
	- Carries Genetic / Epigenetic Signatures

**Applications of cfDNA**
- Non-Invasive Early Screening
	- e.g. <abbr Title="Circulating Cell-Free Genome Atlas">CCGA</abbr> Study: Whole-Genome Bisulfate Sequencing → Detect Cancer-Specific Methylation in cfDNA
- Diagnosis, Localization & Staging
- Monitor Therapy Response, Relapse / Resistance

**Challenges of cfDNA**
- Variable cfDNA Release & Specificity
	- ∵ Interpatient Variation
- Tumor Heterogenicity
- Background Noises


#### **Synthetic Biosensors in Early Detection**
-
