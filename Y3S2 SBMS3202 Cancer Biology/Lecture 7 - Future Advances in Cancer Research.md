#### **cfDNA in Early Detection**
- Tumor shed fragmented carcinogenic cfDNA into bloodstream
	- ↑ cfDNA in Cancer Patients
	- Carries Genetic / Epigenetic Signatures

**Applications of cfDNA**
- Non-Invasive Early Screening
	- e.g. <abbr Title="Circulating Cell-Free Genome Atlas">CCGA</abbr> Study: Whole-Genome Bisulfate Sequencing → Detect Cancer-Specific Methylation in cfDNA
- Diagnosis, Localization & Staging
- Monitor Therapy Response, Relapse / Resistance

**Challenges of cfDNA**
- Test Imperfections
- Unable in ↓ Mortality
- Finding <abbr Title="Showing Little to No Progression">Indolent</abbr> Diseases
- Patient Anxiety
	- ↓ Adherence to Standard Screening / Validation after Positive Results


#### **Synthetic Biosensors in Early Detection**
- Engineered Molecular Probes / Cells that Amplifies Signals (Reporters) from Early Cancer → Overcome Natural Biomarker Limitations:
	- Variable Biomarker Release & Specificity
		- ∵ Interpatient Variation
	- Tumor Heterogenicity
	- Background Noises

**Applications of Synthetic Biosensors**
- Overexpression of <abbr Title="e.g. Matrix Metalloproteinase">Proteases</abbr> in Cancer can cleave Peptide Synthetic Biosensors into Reporters
	- Multiplexed using Barcoding
- Tumor-Specific / Microenvironment Transcription Signals can induce Synthetic Cells / Vectors to release Reporters

**Challenges of Synthetic Biosensors**
- Same as cfDNA


#### **3D Mapping of Tumors**
- Single-Cell Resolution (<abbr Title="Single-Cell RNA Sequencing">scRNA-seq</abbr>) + Spatial Information (Spatial Biology / Transcriptomics) = 3D Mapping of Tumors

**Types of Spatial Biology**

| Type                        | Description |
| --------------------------- | ----------- |
| Microdissection-Based       |             |
| In-Situ Hybridization-Based |             |
| In-Situ Sequencing-Based    |             |
| In-Situ Capturing-Based     |             |
