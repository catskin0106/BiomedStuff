#### **cfDNA in Early Detection**
- Tumor shed fragmented carcinogenic cfDNA into bloodstream
	- ↑ cfDNA in Cancer Patients
	- Carries Genetic / Epigenetic Signatures

**Applications of cfDNA**
- Non-Invasive Early Screening
	- e.g. <abbr Title="Circulating Cell-Free Genome Atlas">CCGA</abbr> Study: Whole-Genome Bisulfate Sequencing → Detect Cancer-Specific Methylation in cfDNA
- Diagnosis, Localization & Staging
- Monitor Therapy Response, Relapse / Resistance

**Challenges of cfDNA**
- Test Imperfections
- Finding <abbr Title="Showing Little to No Progression">Indolent</abbr> Diseases
- Patient Anxiety
	- ↓ Adherence to Standard Screening / Validation after Positive Results


#### **Synthetic Biosensors in Early Detection**
- Engineered Molecular Probes / Cells that Amplifies Signals from Early Cancer → Overcome Natural Biomarker Limitations:
	- Variable Biomarker Release & Specificity
		- ∵ Interpatient Variation
	- Tumor Heterogenicity
	- Background Noises
