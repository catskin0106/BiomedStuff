Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Smoking
- Alcohol
- Obesity
- Diet
- Inactivity
- Other Lifestyle Factors

---
#### **Smoking**
- Lung & Kidney Cancers

**Carcinogenicity of Tobacco**
- Oncogene Activator, Tumor Suppressor Silencer & Mutagen
	- → Sustained Proliferative Signaling
	- → Resisting Apoptosis
	- → Angiogenesis
	- → Invasion & Metastasis

**Cancer Prevention on Tobacco**
- MPOWER Measures:
	- Monitor tobacco use & prevention policies
	- Protect people from smoke
	- Offer help to quit smoking
	- Warn about smoking dangers
	- Enforce tobacco advertisement bans
	- Raise tobacco taxes


#### **Alcohol**
- Alimentary Canal, Liver & Breast Cancers

**Carcinogenicity of Alcohol**
- Metabolism of Carcinogenic Compounds
	- Alcohol → (<abbr Title="Alcohol Dehydrogenase">ADH</abbr>) → Acetaldehyde
		- Disrupts DNA Repair
	- Ethanol → (Liver CYP2E1) → <abbr Title="Reactive Oxygen Species">ROS</abbr> (↑ Oxidative Stress)
		- DNA, Protein & Lipid Damage
	- ↑ Estrogen in women
		- Carcinogenic Proliferation of Breast Epithelium
	- ↓ Colorectal Folate Metabolism → ↓ Methionine 
		- Abnormal DNA Methylation
- Synergistic Effect with other Carcinogens
	- ↑ Tobacco Absorption
	- Weaken Mucosa & Gut Microbiome
		- ↑ HPV & GI Inflammation Risk
- Chronic Inflammation → Immunoescape

**Cancer Prevention on Alcohol**
- Same as Tobacco MPOWER but on alcohol

#### **Obesity**
- Many Cancers

**Carcinogenicity of Obesity**
- Metabolism of Carcinogenic Compounds
	- <abbr Title="Visceral Adipose Tissue">VAT</abbr> Hyperplastic & Hypertrophic Adipocytes → ↑ ROS
	- ↑ Estrogen in women
		- Carcinogenic Proliferation of Breast & Uterine Epithelium
	- ↑ Insulin Resistance → ↑ <abbr Title="Insulin-like Growth Factor 1">IGF-1</abbr>
		- ↑ Proliferation & ↓ Apoptosis
		- ↓ <abbr Title="Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin">SHBG</abbr> → ↑ Free Estrogen & Testosterone
- Synergistic Effect with other Carcinogens
	- Weaken Gut Microbiome
- Chronic Inflammation → Immunoescape
	- <abbr Title="Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease">NAFLD</abbr> → Liver Cirrhosis → <abbr Title="Hepatocellular Carcinoma">HCC</abbr>
	- Chronic Inflammation in <abbr Title="Gastro-esophageal Reflux Disease">GERD</abbr> → Barrett's Esophagus

**Cancer Prevention on Obesity**
- See Diet

#### **Diet**
- Alimentary Canal Cancers

**Carcinogenicity of Diet**
- Leads to Obesity
- Red / Processed Meat
	- ↑ ROS & Gut Inflammation
- Plant / Fiber-rich & Mediterranean Diet Pattern
	- Antioxidant Effect

**Cancer Prevention on Diet**
- Limit Portion Sizes
- Balanced Diet
	- ↓ Red / Processed Meat
	- ↑ Plant / Fiber-rich Diet
- Avoid Sugary & Alcoholic Drinks


#### **Inactivity**
**Carcinogenicity of Inactivity**
- Leads to Obesity
- Immunity Suppression → Immunoescape
	- ↓ NK cell, CTL & Macrophage Activity


#### **Other Lifestyle Factors**
**UV Radiation**
- DNA Damage → Mutation
- ↑ cisUCA & transUCA → Immunity Suppression
