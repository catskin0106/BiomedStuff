#### **Oncogene Addiction**
**Oncogene Actions**
- Increased:
	- Growth Factor Products / Receptors
	- Cell Cycle Components (e.g. Cyclins & CDKs)
- Mutant:
	- Signal Transducer
	- Transcription Factors

**Oncogene Addiction**
- Tumor maintenance highly dependent on continued activity of specific & constitutively activated oncogenes
- Resultant Oncoproteins can be targets for target therapies if criteria are met:
	- Recurrent: Consistently contributing to certain cancer types
	- Druggable
- Examples of cancer types with oncogene addiction:

|                      Cancer Type                      |       Mutation        |         Oncogene         |
| :---------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------: | :----------------------: |
|                       Melanoma                        |     BRAF Mutation     |      Ser/Thr Kinase      |
| <abbr Title="Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia">CML</abbr> | BCL-ABL Translocation |     Tyrosine Kinase      |
|                     Breast Cancer                     |  HER2 Amplification   | Tyrosine Kinase Receptor |
|              Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer               |    ERBB1 Mutation     | Tyrosine Kinase Receptor |

**Targeted Therapy on Oncogene Addiction**
- <abbr Title="Trastuzumab">Herceptin</abbr>: Humanized antibody with high specificity & affinity with HER2 Protein
	- Targets HER2 Amplification in Breast Cancer
	- Ineffective on Breast Cancer without HER2 Amplifcation
- Drug Resistance might be acquired


#### **Cell Senescence**
- Self-defense mechanism that arrests cell proliferation to prevent neoplastic transformation of at-risk cells

**Characteristics of Senescence Cells**
- Flattened, Enlarged Morphologies
- Withdrawal from Cell Cycle
- Resistance to Apoptosis
- Damaged <abbr Title="DNA, Proteins, Lipids">Macromolecules</abbr>
- Secretes <abbr Title="Senescence-Associated Secretion Phenotype">SASPs</abbr> Factors
	- Cytokines: Immunoresponses → Tumor Regression
	- Chemokines: Inflammation
	- Growth Factors: Proliferation
		- Might lead to Tumor Progression
	- Proteases: Cell Invasion
	- Angiogenic Factors: Angiogenesis
- ↑ Metabolism & Lysosomal Activity


#### **Metabolic Reprogramming**
- Consequences of Oncogene Activation / tumor Suppressor Inactivation
	- Promotes uncontrolled proliferation under environment with poor oxygen & nutrient supply
