#### **Oncogene Addiction**
**Oncogene Actions**
- Increased:
	- Growth Factor Products / Receptors
	- Cell Cycle Components (e.g. Cyclins & CDKs)
- Mutant:
	- Signal Transducer
	- Transcription Factors

**Oncogene Addiction**
- Tumor maintenance highly dependent on continued activity of specific & constitutively activated oncogenes
- Resultant Oncoproteins can be targets for target therapies if criteria are met:
	- Recurrent: Consistently contributing to certain cancer types
	- Druggable
- Examples of cancer types with oncogene addiction:

|                      Cancer Type                      |       Mutation        |         Oncogene         |
| :---------------------------------------------------: | :-------------------: | :----------------------: |
|                       Melanoma                        |     BRAF Mutation     |      Ser/Thr Kinase      |
| <abbr Title="Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia">CML</abbr> | BCL-ABL Translocation |     Tyrosine Kinase      |
|                     Breast Cancer                     |  HER2 Amplification   | Tyrosine Kinase Receptor |
|              Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer               |    ERBB1 Mutation     | Tyrosine Kinase Receptor |

**Targeted Therapy on Oncogene Addiction**
- <abbr Title="Trastuzumab">Herceptin</abbr>: Humanized antibody with high specificity & affinity with HER2 Protein
	- Targets HER2 Amplification in Breast Cancer
	- Ineffective on Breast Cancer without HER2 Amplifcation
- Drug Resistance might be acquired


#### **Cell Senescence**
- Self-defense mechanism that arrests cell proliferation to prevent neoplastic transformation of at-risk cells

**Characteristics of Senescence Cells**
- Flattened, Enlarged Morphologies
- Withdrawal from Cell Cycle
- Resistance to Apoptosis
- Damaged <abbr Title="DNA, Proteins, Lipids">Macromolecules</abbr>
- Secretes <abbr Title="Senescence-Associated Secretion Phenotype">SASPs</abbr> Factors
	- Cytokines: Immunoresponses → Tumor Regression
	- Chemokines: Inflammation
	- Growth Factors: Proliferation
		- Might lead to Tumor Progression
	- Proteases: Cell Invasion
	- Angiogenic Factors: Angiogenesis
- ↑ Metabolism & Lysosomal Activity


#### **Metabolic Reprogramming**
- Consequences of Oncogene Activation / tumor Suppressor Inactivation
	- Promotes uncontrolled proliferation under environment with poor oxygen & nutrient supply

**6 Critical Hallmarks of Cancer Metabolism**
- ↑ Glucose & Glutamine Uptake
	- ∵ ↑ PI3K-Akt Oncogenic Pathway 
		- → ↑ <abbr Title="Glucose Transporter">GLUT1</abbr>
	- ∵ ↑ c-Myc Oncogene & ↓ Tumor Suppressor Rb
		- ↑ <abbr Title="Glutamine Transporter">ASCT2/SN2</abbr>

- ↑ Nitrogen Demand from Glutamine
	- For de novo synthesis of nucleotides & polyamines
	- Cell Acquires Nitrogen from Nucleotide Synthesis
		- Glutamine deamination into Glutamate

- ↑ Lactate from Aerobic Glycolysis
	- ↓ Dendritic & T Cell Activation → Immune-permissive Microenvironment
	- Converts Macrophages to M2 State → Immunosuppression
	- ↑ Angiogenesis
	- ↑ Fibroblast Hyaluronic Acid → ↑ Tumor Invasiveness
	- ↑ Acidity → ECM Proteolysis → ↑ Tumor Invasiveness

- ↑ Diversity of Biomolecule Production from Glycolysis / TCA Cycle Intermediates
	- Normal Cells: Glucose → Mitochondrial Acetyl-CoA → Mainly ATP
	- Cancer Cells: Glucose → Reduced Carbon → 
		- Fatty Acid, Glycerol & Cholesterol
		- Sugar Derivatives (5-6C)
		- Non-essential Amino Acids
		- Nucleotides
		- ↓ ATP

- Opportunistic Modes of Nutrient Acquisition
	- ∵ ↑ Ras / c-Src
		- ↑ <abbr Title="Engulfment & Digestion of entire living cells">Entosis</abbr>, Macropinocytosis & <abbr Title="Engulfment & Digestion of Apoptotic Bodies">Phagocytosis</abbr>

- Alterations in Metabolite-Driven Gene Regulation
	- ↑ / ↓ <abbr Title="e.g. Acetyl-CoA">Cofactors</abbr> & <abbr Title="e.g. NAD & FAD">Substrates</abbr> for Histone Acetylation & Methylation
