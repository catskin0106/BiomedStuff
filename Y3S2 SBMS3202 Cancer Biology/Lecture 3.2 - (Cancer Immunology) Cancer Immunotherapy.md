| Purpose               | Preventative (e.g. HPV-driven Cervical Cancer)<br>Therapeutic (e.g. <abbr Title="Advanced Hormone-Resisted Prostate Cancer">Sipuleucel-T</abbr>) |
| Targeted TAAs         |                                                                                                                                                  |
| Platform / Adjuvent   | Tumor cells / DNA / Peptides                                                                                                                     |
| DC Targeting Strategy | Ex vivo / In vivo Internalization of TAAs                                                                                                        |


**Adoptive Cell Transfer Strategy / Cell-Based Immunotherapy**
- Transfer of Natural / Engineered Immune Effector Cells
	- TAA-Specific T Cell Transfer
	- Recombinant TCR
	- <abbr Title="Chimeric Antigen Receptor">CAR</abbr> T Cell Therapy: "Chimera" of spliced domains
		- Antigen-binding Domain from Antibodies
		- CD3Î¶ Signaling Domains TCR Complex (Transmembrane & Intracellular)
		- Co-stimulatory Domains (Intracellular)
- Limitations:
	- High Cost
	- TME-Dependent Effectiveness
	- Rejection
		- Cell Migration, Survival & Proliferation Ability
		- Fatal Side Effects (<abbr Title="Cytokine Release Syndrome">CRS</abbr>, Neurological Toxicity)


**Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy**
