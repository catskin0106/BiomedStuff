| Purpose               | Preventative (e.g. HPV-driven Cervical Cancer)<br>Therapeutic (e.g. <abbr Title="Advanced Hormone-Resisted Prostate Cancer">Sipuleucel-T</abbr>) |
| Targeted TAAs         |                                                                                                                                                  |
| Platform / Adjuvent   | Tumor cells / DNA / Peptides                                                                                                                     |
| DC Targeting Strategy | Ex vivo / In vivo Internalization of TAAs                                                                                                        |


**Adoptive Cell Transfer Strategy / Cell-Based Immunotherapy**
- Transfer of Natural / Engineered Immune Effector Cells
	- TAA-Specific T Cell Transfer
	- Recombinant TCR
	- <abbr Title="Chimeric Antigen Receptor">CAR</abbr> T Cell Therapy: "Chimera" of spliced domains
		- Antigen-binding Domain from Antibodies
		- CD3ζ Signaling Domains TCR Complex (Transmembrane & Intracellular)
		- Co-stimulatory Domains (Intracellular)
- Limitations:
	- High Cost
	- TME-Dependent Effectiveness
	- Rejection
		- Cell Migration, Survival & Proliferation Ability
		- Fatal Side Effects (<abbr Title="Cytokine Release Syndrome">CRS</abbr>, Neurological Toxicity)


**Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy**
- Inhibiting Co-inhibitory Immune Checkpoints to prevent T Cell Exhaustion
	- Maintains immune response in desired physiological range to prevent autoimmunity
- Factors to determine ICB Effectiveness:

#### **Challenges in Cancer Immunotherapy**
- Hard to Achieve Durable Responses & Survival
	- ∵ Cancer Cell Heterogenicity
	- ∵ Complex & Highly regulated Immune System
	- ∵ Low Specificity towards Different patients with Different microenvironments
