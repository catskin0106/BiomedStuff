Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Age
- Genetics
- Pathogens

---
#### **Age**
**Carcinogenicity of Age**
- DNA Damage Accumulation
	- → Genomic & Epigenetic Alteration


#### **Genetics**
- Hereditary Cancer: Caused by an inherited gene mutation
- Familial Cancer: Occurs more frequently but shows no mutation inheritance


#### **Pathogens**
- Can be caused by H. Pylori & Hepatitis (B, C) Virus
- Opportunistic Infection by Streptococcus Anginosus

**Carcinogenicity of H. Pylori**
- Linked Hallmarks:
	- Chronic Inflammation
	- Oncogene Activation & Tumor Suppressor Loss
	- Microbiome Eradication
- Chronic Gastritis → Atrophy → Intestinal Metaplasia & Dysplasia → Cancer
