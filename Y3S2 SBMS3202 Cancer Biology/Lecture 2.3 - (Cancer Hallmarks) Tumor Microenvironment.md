#### **Seed and Soil Theory**

|    Structure     |   Analogy    |
| :--------------: | :----------: |
|   Weed (Seed)    | Tumor Cells  |
|   Normal Plant   | Normal Cells |
| Microenvironment |     Soil     |
- Metastasis is due to preferential microenvironment (soil) being suitable for tumor cell (weed) growth


#### **Cell Types in Tumor Microenvironment**
- Vascular, Immune & Mesenchymal Cells

**Vascular Cells**
- Endothelial Cells: 
	- Form the Tumor-Associated Vasculature
- Pericytes: 
	- With Finger-like Projections wrapping around Capillary Endothelial Tubings
		- "Protection Layer" to prevent cancer cell intravasation into circulatory system
		- Poor pericyte coverage: More prone to hematogenous dissemination
	- Tumor Pericytes have distinct cell-surface markers
		- Potential target for Vasculature-targeted therapy

**Immune Cells**
- Can both hinder / promote tumor cells
- Immunosurveillance Cells (Hinder):
	- CD8<sup>+</sup> Cytotoxic Lymphocytes
	- NK Cells
	- Partially Differentiated Myeloid Cells
- Immunosuppressive Cells (Promote)
	- <abbr Title="Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells">MDSC</abbr>: Promotes metastasis & Evades Immunosurveillance
	- <abbr Title="Tumor Associated Macrophages">TAM</abbr>

**Supporting Mesenchymal Cells: Cancer-Associated Fibroblasts**
- Enhances Tumor Phenotypes by releasing ECM components of <abbr Title="Growth of Fibrous Connective Tissues associated with malignant tumors">Desmoplastic Stroma</abbr>
- Origins:
	- Proliferation from Pre-existing Stromal Cells
	- In Situ Differentiation of Local Progenitor / Stem Cells
	- Recruitment of Bone-Marrow derived Progenitor / Stem Cells
- Types:
	- Similar to Normal Connective Tissue Fibroblasts
	- Myofibroblasts



#### **Cancer Phenotypes from Tumor Microenvironment**
**Reciprocal Heterotypic Signaling Interactions**
- Alternating Interactions between Stroma, Neoplasm & Dynamic ECM

| Step | Signal Origin          | Description                                             |
| ---- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | (Incipient) Neoplasm   | Form Preneoplastic Stroma from recruiting stromal cells |
| 2    | (Preneoplastic) Stroma | Enhance Neoplasm Phenotypes                             |
| 3    | Neoplasm               | Recruit more stromal cells to serve neoplasm            |
| 4    | Stroma                 | Enable Neoplasm to invade & disseminate normal tissues  |

**Tumor-Intrinsic Mechanisms**
- Regulate Chemokine expression → Control immune infiltration
	- High T Cell Infiltration: Hot (Inflamed) Phenotype
	- Low T Cell Infiltration: Cold (Non-inflamed) Phenotype
- Immune Infiltration affects:
	- Tumor Progression
	- Alter Spontaneous / Therapy-induced tumor-specific T cell immunity


**Immunosuppression by Abnormal Tumor Vasculature**
- Immunosuppression from Acidosis & Hypoxia
	- Mechanisms:

| Affected Cells                                                 | Event                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Treg Cells                                                     | Accumulation, Activation & Expansion         |
| <abbr Title="Tumor Associated Macrophages">TAM</abbr>s & MDSCs | Being Recruited                              |
| Dendritic Cells                                                | Suppressed Maturation → Impairs APC Function |
| Immunosuppressive Endothelial Cells                            | Expansion                                    |

**Cancer Metastasis**
- Autocrine & Paracrine Activation of Cancer Cells to Chemokines
	- Autocrine: By Cancer Cells themselves
	- Paracrine: Stromal & Immune Cells
