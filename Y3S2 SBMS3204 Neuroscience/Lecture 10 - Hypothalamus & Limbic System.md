Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Hypothalamus
- Limbic System

---
#### **Hypothalamus**
- Coordination of Autonomic, Endocrine & Somatic Motor Responses accompanied with <abbr Title="Subjective & Conscious Experience that Usually Accompany Emotional Responses">Feelings</abbr>
	- Govern <abbr Title="Automatic & Unconscious Physiological Responses in Special Situations, often accompanied by feelings">Emotional Responses</abbr>

**Anatomy**
- Located under the Thalamus in the Diencephalon
- Interconnected nuclei groups across Anterior, Posterior & Tubular regions
- Connections:
	- Input:
