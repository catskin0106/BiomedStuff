#### **Definition of Autism Spectrum Disorder**
- Neurodevelopmental Disorder with Underlying Cognitive Features
	- Deficit in Social Communication & Interaction
		- Impairments in Reciprocal / Verbal Communications & Maintaining Relationship
	- Restricted & Repeated Patterns of Behavior & Interests
		- Stereotyped Behavior with Insistence on Consistency
		- Highly Restricted Interested
		- Sensory Hyper-/Hypo-Sensitivity
- Spectrum with varying levels of severity & support needed


#### **Factors of Autism Spectrum Disorder**
**Genetic Factors**
- Highly Heritable
- Genetically Heterogenous: From >102 Synaptic / Regulatory genes
	- Most cases are common polygenic variants
		- Deletion of Chromosomal Region: 16p11.2 Microdeletion Syndrome
	- Rare cases include:
		- <abbr Title="Single Nucleotide Variants">SNV</abbr>s
		- <abbr Title="Copy Number Variants">CNV</abbr>s: Fragile X Syndrome
		- Mitochondrial DNA Variants

**Environmental Factors**
- Evidence Levels Vary:

| :--------------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
| <br><br><br>High | Advanced Paternal / Maternal Age               |

#### **Pathophysiology of Autism Spectrum Disorder**
- Affected Biological Pathways in Neuronal Connectivity Development & Function:
	- → Altered early brain development trajectories: Faster in year 1-2 → Subsequent Normalization / Slow Growth

| Affected Components  |        Examples         | Description                                     |
| :------------------: | :---------------------: | ----------------------------------------------- |
|   Gene Regulation    |      CHD8 & MECP2       | Affects Chromatin Remodeling & Transcription    |
|   mRNA Processing    |          FMRP           | Particularly Affects Synaptic Protein Synthesis |
|  Synaptic Proteins   | Neurexins & Neuroligins | Affects Synapse Structure & Plasticity          |
| Synthesized Proteins |          UBE3A          | Degrades Synthesized Proteins                   |


**Features of ASD Pathophysiology**
- Genetic Convergence: Many identified ASD risk genes converge on specific biological pathways
- Spatiotemporal Impact: Impact of ASD risk genes mostly concentrate in specific time windows & brain regions
	- Time Window: Mid-Gestation
	- Brain Regions: Frontal & Temporal Cortex
