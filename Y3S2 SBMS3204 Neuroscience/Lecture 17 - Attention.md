**Lecture Coverage:**
- Attention

---
#### **Attention**
**Definition**
- Selectively Allocation of Limited Neural Resources
	- → Process specific information
	- → Suppressing other concurrently available information

**Purpose**
- Finer analysis of relevant & <abbr Title="Visually Conspicuous">salient</abbr> stimuli with limited brain processing capacity
- Construct conscious perception from allocating attention on sensory "fragments"
	- e.g. Change Blindness: Visual scene changes are unnoticed unless attended to

**Types of Attention**
- Endogenous (Volitional / Top-Down):
	- Consciously directing attention to stimuli based on internal goals
	- e.g. Explicit Instructions alter Saccadic Patterns
- Exogenous (Automatic / Bottom-Up):
	- Unconsciously directing attention to salient / surprising stimuli
	- e.g. Saccades often Fixate on Salient Feature like Faces

#### **Biased Competition Model**
- Competition for Neural Representation & Processing Resources between Endogenous & Exogenous Attention
	-
