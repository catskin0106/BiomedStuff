**1. (a) The basal ganglia may influence cortical activities through 2 separate channels, known as the direct and indirect pathways, respectively. Describe these two pathways. How would the activation of each of these pathways influence movement production? (7 marks)**

*   **Direct Pathway:** Originates from cortical excitation (+) of the Putamen. Putamen neurons (-) inhibit the Globus Pallidus internal segment (GPi) (-). The GPi normally inhibits the Thalamus (-). Therefore, activation sequence is: Cortex (+) → Putamen (-) → GPi (-) → Thalamus (+). The double inhibition (Putamen on GPi, GPi on Thalamus) results in disinhibition (excitation) of the Thalamus, which then excites (+) the Motor Cortex.
    *   *Influence:* Activation of the direct pathway **facilitates movement** ("Go" signal or "ON"). Overall effect: (+)(-)(-) (+) = (+) excitation of cortex.
*   **Indirect Pathway:** Also originates from cortical excitation (+) of the Putamen. Putamen neurons (-) inhibit the Globus Pallidus external segment (GPe) (-). GPe normally inhibits the Subthalamic Nucleus (STN) (-). The STN excites (+) the GPi (-), which inhibits the Thalamus (-). Thalamus excites (+) the Motor Cortex. Activation sequence: Cortex (+) → Putamen (-) → GPe (-) → STN (+) → GPi (-) → Thalamus (+).
    *   *Influence:* Activation of the indirect pathway **suppresses movement** ("No-Go" signal or "OFF"). Overall effect: (+)(-)(-)(+)(-) (+) = (-) inhibition of cortex.

**(b) Hemiballismus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by involuntary, sudden, violent, and often high-amplitude movement. Lesions of which brain region(s) within the direct and/or indirect pathway(s) may lead to this condition? Why? (2 marks)**

*   A lesion in the **Subthalamic Nucleus (STN)** is the most common cause of hemiballismus.
*   *Reasoning:* The STN is part of the indirect pathway and normally *excites* the inhibitory GPi. A lesion (damage) to the STN leads to *reduced* excitatory drive onto the GPi. This results in *less* inhibition from the GPi onto the thalamus. The disinhibited thalamus then excessively excites the motor cortex, leading to the hyperkinetic, involuntary movements characteristic of hemiballismus.

**(c) Hemiballismus may be controlled by providing deep brain stimulation (DBS), through a surgically implanted electrode, to a specific region in basal ganglia. DBS works by inhibiting neurons of the implanted region through very high frequency stimulation, which inactivates sodium channels through persistent over-depolarization. Given this DBS mechanism, which basal ganglia region should DBS target to alleviate hemiballismus? You may assume that some neurons in the lesioned region(s) in (b) still survive. (1 mark)**

*   Given that hemiballismus is typically caused by reduced output from the GPi (due to STN lesion), leading to thalamic disinhibition, DBS aiming to *inhibit* neural activity should target a structure whose inhibition would *reduce* the hyperkinetic output. Inhibiting the **Globus Pallidus internal segment (GPi)** itself via DBS could potentially normalize the excessive output, or perhaps inhibiting the **overactive thalamic nucleus** receiving basal ganglia input could directly reduce the drive to the cortex. *However, paradoxically, high-frequency stimulation of the STN itself is sometimes used, suggesting complex network effects beyond simple inhibition.* Based *purely* on inhibiting an output driving excessive movement, inhibiting the **thalamus** or the remaining **GPi** output neurons would be logical targets to reduce the hyperkinetic drive. *(If assuming STN lesion is the cause as per typical hemiballismus):* Inhibiting the **GPi** might normalize the reduced inhibition it exerts on the thalamus, or inhibiting the **thalamus** directly would reduce the output to the cortex.

**2. During spatial memory formation, hippocampus plays an important role in the initial binding of the neocortical neurons relevant to the memory. Also, many neurons in the CA3 and CA1 regions are classified as place cells.**

**(a) What are place cells? (3 marks)**

*   Place cells are neurons found mainly in the CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus. Each place cell fires action potentials robustly only when an animal occupies a specific location within its environment, known as the cell's "place field". Collectively, the activity of many place cells forms a neural representation of the spatial environment, often referred to as an internal spatial map or cognitive map.

**(b) What is the difference between place cells and engram cells in the CA regions? (3 marks)**

*   **Place cells** are primarily defined by their location-specific firing – they encode *where* the animal is in space. Their firing is tied to a specific physical location (place field) within an environment.
*   **Engram cells** represent the physical substrate (the enduring cellular changes) of a *memory itself*. They are activated during learning and their reactivation is associated with memory recall. While an engram cell *could* be involved in a spatial memory (and thus be active when the animal is in a certain place *associated with that memory*), its defining characteristic is its link to the *memory content* (which could be spatial, contextual, or episodic), not just the physical location *per se*. Research suggests hippocampal engram cells may map *experience* rather than just place alone.

**(c) “Hippocampus is heavily affected in Alzheimer’s disease.” Refute or support this statement with examples. (4 marks)**

*   **Support.** This statement is strongly supported. The hippocampus is one of the earliest and most severely affected brain regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
    *   **Pathology:** Post-mortem studies and imaging show significant **hippocampal atrophy (shrinkage)**, along with the characteristic accumulation of **amyloid-β plaques** and **neurofibrillary tangles (phospho-tau)** within the hippocampus and related MTL structures like the entorhinal cortex.
    *   **Functional Impairment:** AD mouse models demonstrate **disrupted place cell function** (e.g., impaired remapping in new environments) within the hippocampus. Human studies show **altered hippocampal activation** patterns during memory tasks (increased in MCI, likely decreased in later AD).
    *   **Clinical Correlation:** This pathology directly correlates with the prominent clinical symptom of AD, which is severe impairment in forming new **declarative memories**, particularly **episodic memory** – functions critically dependent on the hippocampus.

**3. (a) Neurogenesis happens at the ventricular zone of the developing cortex, with phases of symmetric and asymmetric cell division, respectively. What are the differences between these two phases? (2 marks)**

*   **Symmetric Division:** A neural precursor cell divides to produce **two identical daughter precursor cells**. This phase primarily serves to **exponentially expand the pool of precursor cells**.
*   **Asymmetric Division:** A neural precursor cell divides to produce **one daughter precursor cell** (maintaining the pool) and **one neuroblast** (a postmitotic cell destined to become a neuron). This phase primarily serves to **generate the neurons** that will populate the cortex.

**(b) Primates have a much larger cortical area and cortical thickness as compared with those of the rodents. What are the two potential mechanisms leading to these differences? (4 marks)**

1.  **Increased Cortical Area:** Primarily attributed to a **prolonged duration of the symmetric division phase** of neural precursors in the ventricular zone. This generates a larger initial pool of progenitor cells, which subsequently leads to the formation of a larger surface area.
2.  **Increased Cortical Thickness:** Primarily attributed to a **prolonged duration of the asymmetric division phase**. This results in the generation of a greater number of neurons over a longer period, which migrate outwards to populate and build thicker cortical layers. (Additionally, the presence of expanded progenitor zones like the OSVZ in primates contributes).

**(c) Do you think it is possible to generate gyri in a rodent brain with genetic engineering? If so, how? If not, why? (4 marks)**

*   **Unlikely with current simple genetic engineering.** While theoretically possible in the distant future, generating gyri (folds) is a highly complex process.
    *   **Why not easily:** Gyri formation isn't just about making more neurons or a larger surface area; it involves intricate **mechanical forces, differential growth rates between layers, specific patterns of neuronal migration, and precise regulation of gene expression** controlling cell adhesion and cortical expansion dynamics. Rodent brains lack the necessary developmental programs and likely the progenitor populations (e.g., abundant outer radial glia in OSVZ) required for this complex folding. Simply increasing progenitor numbers (e.g., by extending symmetric division via manipulating a single gene) might increase surface area but is unlikely to induce the characteristic folding patterns seen in gyrencephalic brains like primates. It would likely require manipulating a complex network of developmental genes and pathways in a precisely orchestrated spatiotemporal manner, which is currently beyond our capabilities.

**4. (a) Name three signs of autism that can be observed in a 1.5-year-old baby. (3 marks)**

1.  **Reduced social interest/affect:** Lack of warm, joyful emotional expressions; lack of sharing emotional enjoyment or interest.
2.  **Impaired non-verbal communication:** Lack of response to name; lack of showing objects to others or interacting through pointing/gestures; lack of coordination of gaze/facial expression.
3.  **Abnormal language development:** Delays in language milestones or unusual patterns of speech development.

**(b) Individuals diagnosed with autism were found to have a larger brain volume than those without autism. What are the potential mechanisms that lead to this phenomenon? (4 marks)**

*   Potential mechanisms for early brain overgrowth in ASD include:
    *   **Early Overproduction of Neurons:** An increase in the rate or duration of neurogenesis during prenatal or early postnatal development.
    *   **Reduced Apoptosis/Pruning:** Failure of normal programmed cell death or synaptic pruning processes that typically refine brain circuits after initial overproduction.
    *   **Altered Glial Development:** Increased proliferation or altered function of glial cells (astrocytes, microglia).
    *   **Neuroinflammation:** Early immune dysregulation or inflammation affecting brain growth factors or cellular processes.
    *   **Aberrant Synaptogenesis:** Increased or dysregulated formation of synapses.

**(c) Fragile X syndrome is more common in males (1:4000) than in females (1:8000). Why? (3 marks)**

*   Fragile X Syndrome is an **X-linked disorder** caused by a mutation (CGG repeat expansion) in the *FMR1* gene on the X chromosome.
*   **Males (XY):** Have only one X chromosome. If they inherit the mutated *FMR1* gene on that X chromosome, they lack a second, normal copy and will express the disorder, often with significant severity.
*   **Females (XX):** Have two X chromosomes. If they inherit one mutated X chromosome, they usually have a second, normal X chromosome. Due to the process of **X-inactivation** (where one X chromosome is randomly silenced in each cell early in development), females are typically mosaic. Some cells express the normal FMR1 protein from the healthy X, while others do not (due to inactivation of the healthy X or expression from the mutated X). This mosaicism often results in females being less frequently affected or having much milder symptoms compared to males.

**5. A patient came to see the doctor complaining about narcolepsy symptoms including excessive daytime sleepiness, and occasional complete weakness of most muscles.**

**(a) Explain the most likely underlying neurological mechanism that causes narcolepsy. In your response, focus on the neurotransmitters and neuropeptides involved in mediating sleep and wakefulness. (4 marks)**

*   The most common cause of narcolepsy with cataplexy (muscle weakness) is the **loss of hypothalamic neurons that produce the neuropeptide hypocretin (also called orexin)**, often due to an autoimmune attack. Hypocretin normally promotes and stabilizes wakefulness by exciting key arousal systems, including those using **norepinephrine** (locus coeruleus), **serotonin** (raphe nuclei), **histamine** (tuberomammillary nucleus), and **dopamine** (ventral tegmental area). It also suppresses REM sleep. Loss of hypocretin leads to destabilization of the sleep-wake switch, resulting in poor consolidation of wakefulness (daytime sleepiness) and inappropriate intrusion of REM sleep phenomena (like muscle atonia causing cataplexy) into wakefulness.

**(b) Suggest two diagnostic tests for narcolepsy and the anticipated results from these tests for a narcolepsy patient. (4 marks)**

1.  **Polysomnogram (PSG) (Overnight Sleep Study):** Measures various physiological signals during sleep.
    *   *Anticipated Result:* May show disrupted nighttime sleep architecture and often a short **REM sleep latency** (entering REM sleep quickly after falling asleep). Primarily used to rule out other sleep disorders (like sleep apnea).
2.  **Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT):** Performed the day after the PSG, involves multiple scheduled nap opportunities.
    *   *Anticipated Result:* A mean sleep latency of **≤ 8 minutes** across the naps, *AND* the presence of **≥ 2 Sleep-Onset REM Periods (SOREMPs)** (entering REM sleep during the short naps).

**(c) In addition to drug treatment, suggest some lifestyle modifications which can help this patient. (2 marks)**

*   **Maintain a regular sleep-wake schedule:** Going to bed and waking up around the same time every day, including weekends.
*   **Schedule short naps:** Taking brief (15-20 minute) strategic naps during the day can help alleviate daytime sleepiness.
*   **(Other possibilities):** Avoid alcohol and sedating medications, especially near bedtime; manage stress; engage in moderate regular exercise (but not too close to bedtime).

**6. (a) Our attentional system may be based on biased competition between different neuronal networks in the higher sensory areas. What is the biased competition model of attention, and how can this model explain endogenous and exogenous attention? (5 marks)**

*   **Biased Competition Model:** This model proposes that multiple stimuli present in the sensory environment simultaneously compete for limited neural processing resources and representation. Attention acts as a mechanism that **biases** this competition in favor of one stimulus or location over others. The "winner" of the competition receives enhanced processing and influences perception and behavior.
*   **Explaining Attentional Types:**
    *   **Exogenous Attention:** The competition is biased by **bottom-up**, stimulus-driven factors. Stimuli that are inherently **salient** (e.g., high contrast, unique feature like orientation, sudden onset, movement) automatically win the competition due to their strong sensory signal, capturing attention involuntarily.
    *   **Endogenous Attention:** The competition is biased by **top-down**, goal-driven factors originating from higher cognitive areas (like parietal/frontal cortex). Internal goals, task instructions, or expectations create an "attentional template" that enhances the processing of task-relevant stimuli or locations, allowing them to win the competition even against more salient but irrelevant distractors.

**(b) Among the brains of different mammalian species, the human brain is unique in that it possesses the largest lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC) by proportion. Speculate on how the inhibitory neuronal networks in the LPFC may interact with the attentional system to facilitate the emergence of unconventional, non-reflexive behaviors of humans. (5 marks)**

*   The proportionally large LPFC in humans is associated with enhanced **inhibitory control** and cognitive flexibility.
*   **Interaction with Attention:** The LPFC likely exerts strong **top-down control** over the attentional system (e.g., modulating activity in SPL/FEF and sensory areas).
*   **Facilitating Non-Reflexive Behavior:**
    1.  **Goal Maintenance:** LPFC maintains current goals and task rules in working memory.
    2.  **Bias Application:** It uses these goals to bias the attentional competition, selectively enhancing processing of goal-relevant information and suppressing irrelevant information.
    3.  **Inhibition of Prepotent Responses:** Crucially, inhibitory networks within the LPFC actively **suppress automatic, reflexive, or habitual responses** that might be triggered by bottom-up sensory inputs but are inappropriate for the current goal.
    4.  **Enabling Flexibility:** By inhibiting these automatic/reflexive pathways and biasing attention towards goal-relevant, potentially non-obvious stimuli or internally generated plans, the LPFC allows for **"unconventional," flexible, context-dependent, and non-reflexive behaviors** that are not simply stimulus-driven reactions. This supports complex planning, reasoning, and adaptive behavior.

**7. (a) Finlay and Darlington (Science, 1995) found that in mammals, species with larger absolute brain sizes also tend to have specific brain regions (such as the neocortex) with disproportionately large sizes. Describe the neurodevelopmental constraint that may account for this observation. (5 marks)**

*   The primary neurodevelopmental constraint accounting for the disproportionate scaling of later-developing regions like the neocortex in larger brains is the **"Late-Equals-Larger Rule"**, which relates to the timing and duration of neurogenesis phases.
*   Neural precursors initially undergo **symmetric division** to expand the progenitor pool, followed by **asymmetric division** to generate neurons.
*   Species with larger brains generally have **longer periods of brain development**.
*   This extended developmental time allows for a **prolonged phase of symmetric division**, generating a much larger initial pool of neural precursors before the switch to asymmetric division.
*   Regions like the neocortex, which are generated relatively late in development (i.e., after a longer period of symmetric division compared to earlier-forming structures), therefore benefit disproportionately from this larger precursor pool, resulting in their significantly larger relative size in species with larger overall brains.

**(b) Across mammalian species, would the neural connectivity within the brain, when compared with the connectivity within brains with smaller absolute sizes? Why? (5 marks)**

*   Compared to smaller brains, larger mammalian brains tend to have:
    1.  **Decreased Connection Density:** The *proportion* of possible connections that actually exist between neurons is lower. If density remained constant, the number of axons would become unmanageably large and metabolically costly.
    2.  **Increased Reliance on Serial Processing:** Information flow relies more on specific, potentially longer, serial pathways rather than highly parallel or densely interconnected local circuits.
    3.  **Increased Absolute Number but Lower Proportion of Long-Range Connections:** While there are more long-range axons in total, they represent a smaller fraction of all connections compared to local wiring.
    4.  **Potentially More Invasional Connections:** Disproportionately large areas (like neocortex) may form connections to target areas that were not innervated by homologous structures in smaller-brained ancestors.
*   **Why?** These features likely arise from evolutionary pressures to balance **wiring cost** (minimizing axon length/volume and metabolic cost) with **functional efficiency** (maintaining both local and global communication). A "small-world" architecture, balancing dense local clustering with sufficient long-range shortcuts, constrained by physical space and metabolic limits, likely shapes connectivity patterns as brains scale up. The need to maintain efficient processing with fewer connections (proportionally) favors more specialized, potentially serial pathways.

**8. (a) The global neuronal workspace theory (GNWT) and the integrated information theory (IIT) provide two plausible mechanisms of how consciousness may arise. Briefly describe the claims of these two theories. (5 marks)**

*   **Global Neuronal Workspace Theory (GNWT):**
    *   Claims consciousness arises when information processed by specialized, otherwise unconscious brain modules is selected and **broadcast** into a central **"global workspace"**.
    *   This workspace involves widespread neuronal networks, particularly involving long-range connections in fronto-parietal regions.
    *   Information in the workspace becomes available to multiple other cognitive processes (e.g., memory, decision-making, verbal report).
    *   Consciousness is thus equated with this state of **global availability and information sharing**.
*   **Integrated Information Theory (IIT):**
    *   Claims consciousness is an **intrinsic, fundamental property** of physical systems possessing a high degree of **integrated information (Φ)**.
    *   Integrated information reflects a system's capacity to have its current state influenced by its own past states and influence its own future states in a way that is both highly differentiated (many possible states) and highly integrated (the system cannot be decomposed into independent parts without losing information).
    *   It requires a specific system architecture with rich **causal interactions** (feedback loops).
    *   Consciousness is identical to this integrated information; the *amount* of consciousness corresponds to the quantity Φ, and the *quality* (qualia) corresponds to the specific structure of the conceptual space generated by the system's causal architecture.

**(b) How may we experimentally demonstrate whether GNWT or IIT is a relatively more valid model of consciousness? Describe a hypothetically feasible experiment in humans, animals, and/or computers that may achieve this goal. (5 marks)**

*   **Goal:** Differentiate predictions of GNW (consciousness = global broadcast/availability) vs. IIT (consciousness = integrated information/Φ).
*   **Hypothetical Experiment (Humans - Combining fMRI/EEG/TMS):**
    1.  **Task:** Use a perceptual task where stimuli can be identical physically but sometimes consciously perceived and sometimes not (e.g., near-threshold visual masking or attentional blink).
    2.  **GNW Prediction:** Conscious perception will correlate with a late, widespread "ignition" of activity, particularly in fronto-parietal networks (the broadcast), significantly different from the more localized activity during unconscious processing.
    3.  **IIT Prediction:** Conscious perception will correlate with a high level of **neural complexity or integrated information (Φ)** across relevant cortical networks (likely posterior cortex initially), measurable even if the broadcast isn't evident. Φ should be low for unconsciously processed stimuli.
    4.  **Method:**
        *   Record high-density EEG or MEG for temporal resolution, and fMRI for spatial localization.
        *   On each trial, present the near-threshold stimulus and ask subject to report perception (seen/unseen).
        *   Use TMS to perturb the cortex and measure the complexity/spread of the resulting EEG response (a proxy for Φ) during stimulus processing for both seen and unseen trials (related to Perturbational Complexity Index - PCI).
    5.  **Analysis:** Compare:
        *   The spatial extent and timing of activation (fMRI/EEG) between seen and unseen trials (Tests GNW's broadcast idea).
        *   The calculated neural complexity/PCI (from TMS-EEG) between seen and unseen trials (Tests IIT's Φ correlation).
    6.  **Outcome:** If widespread late activation strongly differentiates seen/unseen trials better than complexity measures, it supports GNW. If complexity measures strongly differentiate seen/unseen trials (especially if localized differences in complexity appear early in posterior regions), it supports IIT. *(Animal/computer versions would adapt stimuli/measures but follow similar logic comparing neural dynamics/complexity with behavioral indicators or internal states).*
