#### **Human Brain Evolution**
**Drive for Brain Evolution**
- Two Significant Bursts in Brain Size through Emergence of Homo Genus & Homo Sapiens:

| Species      | Evolution                                | Evolution Drive                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Homo Genus   | ↑ Brain Size<br>→ Tool Use, Fire Control | Environmental Changes<br>↑ Nutritional Support       |
| Homo Sapiens | ↑ Social Intelligence & Alliances        | Intraspecies Competition ("Social Brain Hypothesis") |

**Consequences of Larger Brain**
- Disproportionately Large Neocortex (Late-equals-Larger Rule)
- Enhanced Cortical Motor Control (Larger-equals-Well-Connected Rule):
	- Oral & Respiratory Muscles: Oral Dexterity → Speech
	- Independent Fingers: Digital Dexterity → Tool Use
- Enlarged Lateral Prefrontal Cortex:
	- ↓ Impulsive / Reflex Behaviors
	- ↑ Complex / Non-routine Actions
- Serialization: 
	- ↓ Connection Density
	- ↑ Serial Processing Streams
		- Dorsal: "Where" (Spatial Localization & Motion)
		- Ventral: "What" (Object Recognition)
	- ↑ Vulnerability at lower level neurons


#### **Consciousness**
**Definition**
- Capacity of Unified Subjective Experience
	- Qualia: Qualitative Nature of Experience
		- e.g. "Redness"
	- Sense of Agency: Self Awareness ("Cogito, Ergo Sum")
		- e.g. Thoughts, Decisions & Memories

**Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCC)**
- Minimal Neuronal Mechanisms jointly sufficient for any specific Conscious Experience
	- Demands a theory on consci
