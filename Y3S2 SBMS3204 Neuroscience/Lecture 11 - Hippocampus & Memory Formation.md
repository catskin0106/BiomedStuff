#### **Hippocampus in Memory Formation**
**Types of Memories**
- Declarative Memories: Recallable Facts & Events
	- Episodic Memories: Tied to specific Time & Space
	- Semantic Memories: Factual / General World Knowledge
- Non-Declarative Memories: Unconscious Memories through Performance rather than Recall

**Function of the Hippocampus**
- Learnt from the Case of H.M. : <abbr Title="Medial Temporal Lobe">MTL</abbr> removal (including majority of hippocampus)

| Features Exhibited by H.M.                        | MTL Information                                                                                                                                                           |

| Unable to form new long-term declarative memories | Acquiring New Long-Term Declarative Memory is a Distinct MTL Function<br>- Temporary but Crucial Memory Consolidation before "moving" the memory to ultimate storage site |
| Retained declarative memories from before surgery | MTL is not the ultimate storage site of Long-Term Declarative Memories<br>- Real Storage Site: Distributed Networks in Neocortex                                          |
| Able to form new immediate & procedural memories  | MTL is not required for Immediate & Procedural Memories                                                                                                                   |
**Hippocampus in Long-Term Declarative Memory Formation**
- Stages of Memory Formation

|       Stage       | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |

| Initial Encoding  | Hippocampus Binds Distributed Neocortical Neurons together to form an <abbr Title="Enduring physical / chemical changes in the brain that underlies a memory">Engram</abbr> |
|   Consolidation   | Reorganize & Strengthen Direct Connections between Neocortical Neuron                                                                                                       |
| Long-Term Storage | Memory resides within Neocortex<br>- Hippocampus no longer required in Retrieval                                                                                            |
- Cellular Mechanisms: Place Cells in Hippocampus CA1 & CA3
	- Form a <abbr Title="Internal Representation of Space">cognitive map</abbr> in which specific neurons fire when an animal is in a specific <abbr Title="Square area (?) mapped by a single neuron">place field</abbr>
	- Firing → Bind neocortical neurons associated with their respective place field
	- <abbr Title="Long-Term Potentiation">LTP</abbr>: Synaptic Plasticity maintaining stability of the place fields


#### **Relevance to Alzheimer's Disease**
- Hippocampal Shrinkage, Amyloid-β Plagues & Phospho-τ Neurofibrillary Tangles
	- → Disrupted Place Cell Function → Impaired remapping to new environments → Memory Deficit
