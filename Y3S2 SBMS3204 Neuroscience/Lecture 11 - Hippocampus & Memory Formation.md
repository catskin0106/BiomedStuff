#### **Hippocampus in Memory Formation**
**Types of Memories**
- Declarative Memories: Recallable Facts & Events
	- Episodic Memories: Tied to specific time & space
	- Semantic Memories: Factual / Information
- Non-Declarative Memories: Unconscious Memories through Performance rather than Recall

**Function of the Hippocampus**
- Learnt from the Case of H.M. : <abbr Title="Medial Temporal Lobe">MTL</abbr> removal (including majority of hippocampus)

| Features Exhibited by H.M.                        | MTL Information                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unable to form new long-term declarative memories | Acquiring New Long-Term Declarative Memory is a Distinct MTL Function  |
| Retained declarative memories from before surgery | MTL is not the ultimate storage site of Long-Term Declarative Memories |
| Able to form new immediate & procedural memories  | MTL is not required for Immediate & Procedural Memories                |
