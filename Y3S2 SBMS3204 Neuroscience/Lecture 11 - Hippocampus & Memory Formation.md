#### **Hippocampus in Memory Formation**
**Types of Memories**
- Declarative Memories: Recallable Facts & Events
	- Episodic Memories: Tied to specific Time & Space
	- Semantic Memories: Factual / General World Knowledge
- Non-Declarative Memories: Unconscious Memories through Performance rather than Recall

**Function of the Hippocampus**
- Learnt from the Case of H.M. : <abbr Title="Medial Temporal Lobe">MTL</abbr> removal (including majority of hippocampus)

| Features Exhibited by H.M.                        | MTL Information                                                                                                                                                           |

| Unable to form new long-term declarative memories | Acquiring New Long-Term Declarative Memory is a Distinct MTL Function<br>- Temporary but Crucial Memory Consolidation before "moving" the memory to ultimate storage site |
| Retained declarative memories from before surgery | MTL is not the ultimate storage site of Long-Term Declarative Memories<br>- Real Storage Site: Distributed Networks in Neocortex                                          |
| Able to form new immediate & procedural memories  | MTL is not required for Immediate & Procedural Memories                                                                                                                   |
