|  Formulating Goal  | Decide what needs to be achieved                                          |
| Movement Planning  | Planning the end-effector trajectory                                      |
| Inverse Kinematics | Compute Joint Angle Patterns to achieve Trajectory                        |
|  Inverse Dynamics  | Compute Joint Torques & Muscle Activation to achieve Joint Angle Patterns |
|  Motor Execution   | Send Commands to Muscles for Motion Generation                            |


#### **Motor Execution**
- 2 Modes: Feedforward / Feedback Motor Control

**Feedforward Motor Control (Open-Looped)**
- Pre-planned Commands Sent to Muscles without Regard to Sensory Feedback during Movement
	- → Fast & Efficient for well-trained tasks
	- → Can't correct for unexpected errors during execution
- Population Vector Hypothesis: Movement direction is encoded by combined activity of a large motor cortex neuron population
	- → Rapid & Direct generation of feedforward commands

**Feedback Motor Control (Close-Looped)
- Detect Deviations from Desired State of Movement through Sensory Information
	- Accurate & Adaptable but Slower
	- → Adjustments in Motor Command to Correct the Movement


#### **Modulation of Voluntary Movement**
- Carried out by Cerebellum & Basal Ganglia
- Essential for Movement Correction in Feedback Motor Control

**Cerebellum**
- Refiner of movement in coordination, timing, accuracy & motor learning
- Functional Zones:
