#### **Neural Control of Movement**
**Hierarchal Control**
- Involves multiple CNS regions:

| CNS Region    | Function                                                                                                                                                      |

**Motor Unit Execution**
- Motor Unit = Motor Neuron + Muscle Fibre it innervates
	- Motor Neuron: Located in Ventral Horn of Spinal Cord


#### **Reflexes**
- Stereotypical & Usually involuntary motor responses from specific sensory stimuli

**Functions of Reflexes**

|          Function           |            Explanation            | Examples                                                                                                                                            |
| :-------------------------: | :-------------------------------: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <br>Stereotypical Responses |          For Protection           | Withdrawal Reflex                                                                                                                                   |
|              ^              |          For Orientation          | Righting Reflex                                                                                                                                     |
|       Limb Stability        |  Resisting Muscle Length Change   | Monosynaptic Stretch Reflex (Knee Jerk Reflex)<br>- Muscle Spindle → Ia Afferent → Agonist Motoneuron Excitation & Antagonist Motoneuron Inhibition |
|  Preventing Muscle Damage   | Protection from Excessive Tension | Autogenic Inhibition Reflex<br>- GTO → Ib Afferent → Ib Inhibitory Interneuron → Agonist Motoneuron Inhibition                                      |


#### **Locomotion**
- Rhythmic & Cyclical Movements (e.g. Walking, Running & Swimming)
- Spinal Cord can generate basic locomotion patterns without forebrain input
	- Experimental Evidence: Decerebrated cat

**Gait Cycle**
- Walking involves alternating between Stance & Swing phases


#### **Central Pattern Generator**
- CNS Neural Network (Especially Spinal Cord) capable of generating rhythmic motor patterns without continuous rhythmic sensory input
	- Experimental Evidence: Rhythmic Activity persisting after cutting Sensory Roots (Deafferentation)

**Half-Centre Model**
- CPG is comprised of 2 mutually inhibitory neuronal populations
	- Active half inhibits the other until fatigue, in which case the two halves alternate
- Rhythm is not rigid and requires modulation from:
	- Descending signals from the brain: Start, Stop & Modify Speed
	- Sensory Feedback: Adapt rhythm to Environment
