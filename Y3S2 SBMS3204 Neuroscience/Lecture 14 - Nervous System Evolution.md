#### **Concepts of Evolution**
- Evolution: Historical changes in life forms resulting in diversity of species
- Evolution of Evolution Theories:

|        Theory         |       <        | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------: | :------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <br><br>Pre-Darwinian | Scala Naturae  | Static & Hierarchical view of life created by God                                                                                                                                        |
|           ^           | <br>Lamarckism | Adaptive Force:<br>- Continuous Use Enlarges Organ; Disuse Diminishes Organ<br>- All Acquisition / Losses are preserved across generations                                               |
|     <br>Darwinism     |       <        | Offspring Overproduction + Limited Resources = Struggle for Existence<br>→ Variation within Species + Heritability = Natural Selection<br>→ Gradual Adaptation of Species to Environment |

**Interpretation of Similarities across Species**

|            Similarity             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             Homology              | Similarity is due to descent from Common Ancestor<br>- Can be revealed by <abbr Title="Reconstruction of a creature's Phylogenetic History">Cladistics</abbr><br>e.g. Vertebrae Limb Bone Structure |
| Analogy<br>(Convergent Evolution) | Similarity is due to similar Selective Pressures selecting for same trait<br>e.g. Independent Evolution of Spinothalamic Tract                                                                      |

**Limitations of Evolution**
- Leads to Similarity in Structure between Species
- Evolution must work within bounds of what is developmentally possible
	- New Species arise from modifications to the developmental trajectory of ancestors
- Early Developmental Stages are highly conserved across species
	- ∵ Alterations require more fundamental changes


#### **Evolution of Brain Structures**
**Similarity in Brain Structures across Vertebrae**
- Major CNS Divisions are conserved across all vertebrae

**Differences in Brain Structures across Vertebrae**
- Division Sizes Vary
	- Larger Regions = ↑ Extensive Connections & Dominant Role (↑ Influence)
		- Metabolically Expensive → Needs to provide significant fitness advantage to outweigh the cost
	- → Epigenetic Cascade: Trophic Factor Dependencies across regions during development
		- → Size changes in one region can "propagate" to synaptically connected regions
	- → Invasional Connections: Disproportionately large regions can form novel connections to smaller areas previously not innervated by that region
- Explainable by:
	- Mosaic Evolution: Brain region size changes are driven by selection forces
		- → Change independently of one another
	- Concerted Evolution (Dominant in Mammals): Brain region size scales according to an observable rule predicting region size
		- e.g. Absolute Brain Volume
		- e.g. Late-Equals-Larger Rule: Later born regions have larger sizes due to larger Absolute Brain Volume
