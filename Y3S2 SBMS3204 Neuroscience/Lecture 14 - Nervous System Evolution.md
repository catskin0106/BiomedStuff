#### **Concepts of Evolution**
- Evolution: Historical changes in life forms resulting in diversity of species
- Evolution of Evolution Theories:

|        Theory         |       <        | Description                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :-------------------: | :------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <br><br>Pre-Darwinian | Scala Naturae  | Static & Hierarchical view of life created by God                                                                                                                                        |
|           ^           | <br>Lamarckism | Adaptive Force:<br>- Continuous Use Enlarges Organ; Disuse Diminishes Organ<br>- All Acquisition / Losses are preserved across generations                                               |
|     <br>Darwinism     |       <        | Offspring Overproduction + Limited Resources = Struggle for Existence<br>→ Variation within Species + Heritability = Natural Selection<br>→ Gradual Adaptation of Species to Environment |

**Interpretation of Similarities across Species**

|            Similarity             | Description                                                                                                                    |
| :-------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             Homology              | Similarity is due to descent from Common Ancestor<br>e.g. Vertebrae Limb Bone Structure                                        |
| Analogy<br>(Convergent Evolution) | Similarity is due to similar Selective Pressures selecting for same trait<br>e.g. Independent Evolution of Spinothalamic Tract |

**Limitations of Evolution**
- Early Developmental Stages are highly conserved across species
	- ∵ Alterations require more fundamental changes
- Evolution must work within bounds of what is developmentally possible
	- New Species arise from modifications to the developmental trajectory of ancestors
