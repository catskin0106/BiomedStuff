Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Drug Interactions
- Pharmaceutical Interactions
- Pharmacodynamic Interactions
- Pharmacokinetic Interactions
- Food-Drug Interactions

---
#### **Drug Interactions**
- The process where the Object Drug action is affected by the Precipitant Drug
	- Only Important if Object Drug has steep CRC / narrow Therapeutic Window

**Types of Drug Interactions**
- Pharmaceutical: Chemical Reaction between Drugs / Infusion Fluid
- Pharmacodynamic: Interaction of Drugs with Conflicting Targets / Actions
- Pharmacokinetic: Interaction of Drugs affecting ADME


#### **Pharmaceutical Interactions**
- Reaction of Object Drug with:
	- Infusion Fluid Substances (e.g. Glucose)
	- Other Drugs
- Effects:
	- Precipitation → Toxicity / ↓ Drug Activity
	- Detoxification if Overdose

**Examples of Pharmaceutical Interactions**

|         Object Drug         | Precipitant Drug |          Effect           |
| :-------------------------: | :--------------: | :-----------------------: |
|    Diazepam / Phenytoin     |  Infusion Fluid  |     <br>Precipitation     |
| Thiopentone / Suxamethonium |        <         |             ^             |
|           Digoxin           |    Antibodies    | Digibind (Detoxification) |


#### **Pharmacodynamic Interactions**
- Mostly happen when drugs have competitive antagonism at same site

**Examples of Pharmacodynamic Interactions**

| Conflicting Drugs |      <      | Effect |
| :---------------: | :---------: | :----: |
