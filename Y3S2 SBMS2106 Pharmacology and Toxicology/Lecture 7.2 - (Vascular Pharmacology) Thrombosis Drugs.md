#### **Thrombosis**
- Abnormal Activation of Coagulation Cascade → Blood Clot Formation
	- ∵ Oxidized LDL Accumulation on vessel wall → Endothelial Injury

**Coagulation Cascade**
- 3 Pathways: Extrinsic, Intrinsic & Common
- Involves activated factors activating another factor until clot formation:

    subgraph Extrinsic Pathway
		direction LR
		XII-->XI
		XI-->X
    end
    subgraph two
    b1-->b2
    end
    subgraph three
    c1-->c2
    end
    Extrinsic Pathway --> three
    two --> three
```
