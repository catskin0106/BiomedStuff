#### **Thrombosis**
- Abnormal Activation of Coagulation Cascade → Blood Clot Formation
	- ∵ Oxidized LDL Accumulation on vessel wall → Endothelial Injury

**Coagulation Cascade**
- 3 Pathways: Extrinsic, Intrinsic & Common
- Involves activated factors activating another factor until clot formation:
