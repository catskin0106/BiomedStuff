#### **Bathtub Model of Clearance**
-  Drug Elimination (mg/hr): The amount of drug metabolized or excreted per unit time
	- Drug elimination ↑, as Cp & CL↑
- Drug Clearance (mL/hr): The volume of blood cleared from drug per unit time
	- Sum of clearance in all eliminating organs
		- Like water elimination from bathtub ↑ as ↑ water height & ↑ plughole size
		- CL ≈ The volume of bathtub cleared from water

**Systemic Clearance**
- Systemic Clearance = Hepatic + Renal + Pulmonary + Metabolic Clearance
	- Hepatic clearance: Metabolism & Biliary Excretion
	- Renal clearance: Excretion
	- Metabolic Clearance: Drug biotransformation via enzymes


#### **Organ Clearance**
**Hepatic Extraction**
- Hepatic Extraction Rate = Blood Flow (Cp<sub>in</sub> - Cp<sub>out</sub>)
- Hepatic Extraction Ratio = Blood Flow (Cp<sub>in</sub> - Cp<sub>out</sub>) / Blood Flow Cp<sub>in</sub>
- From a scale of 0-1, the amount of drug that gets extracted
- Hepatic Clearance = Blood Flow * Extraction Ratio
- Factors affecting ER:
- Molecular size (PPB Binding)
- Hepatic Perfusion
- Liver Capabilities
- ∴ Alterations in drug dosage are needed to prevent toxicity
