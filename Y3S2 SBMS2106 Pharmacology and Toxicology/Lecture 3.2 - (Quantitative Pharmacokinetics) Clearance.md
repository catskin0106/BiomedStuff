#### **Bathtub Model of Clearance**
**Elimination & Clearance**
-  Drug Elimination (mg/hr): The amount of drug metabolized or excreted per unit time
	- Drug elimination ↑, as Cp & CL↑
- Drug Clearance (mL/hr): The volume of blood cleared from drug per unit time
	- Systemic Clearance: Sum of clearance in all eliminating organs (Hepatic + Renal + Pulmonary + Metabolic)
		- Hepatic clearance: Metabolism & Biliary Excretion
		- Renal clearance: Excretion
		- Pulmonary clearance
		- Metabolic Clearance: Drug biotransformation via enzymes

**Bathtub Model**
 - Like water elimination from bathtub ↑ as ↑ water height & ↑ plughole size
	- CL ≈ The volume of bathtub cleared from water


#### **Hepatic Clearance**
- Hepatic Metabolism + Biliary Excretion

**Hepatic Extraction**
- Hepatic Extraction Rate:$$\Large Blood\;Flow(C_{A}\;-\;C_{V})$$
- Hepatic Extraction Ratio (E):$$\Large E=\frac{Blood\;Flow(C_{A}\;-\;C_{V})}{Blood\;Flow(C_{A})}$$
	- From a scale of 0-1, the amount of administrated drug that gets extracted from liver

**Hepatic Clearance**
- Hepatic Clearance:$$\Large Blood\;Flow (E)$$
- Factors affecting Hepatic Clearance:
	- Amount of PPB drugs unavailable for Hepatic Absorption (Molecular Weight of Drugs)
	- Hepatic Perfusion
	- Liver Metabolizing Capabilities
-  Alterations in drug dosage are needed to prevent toxicity if patient has:
	- Altered Hepatic Blood Flow
	- Altered PPB
	- Altered Hepatic Enzymatic Ability

**Biliary Clearance**
$$\Large \frac{Bile\;Flow(C_{bile})}{C_{p}}$$
**Clearance and Bioavailability**

| **Clearance** | **Bioavailability** |                  **Definition**                  | Rate Limiting Factor |
| :-----------: | :-----------------: | :----------------------------------------------: | :------------------: |
|     High      |         Low         | Hepatic: E > 0.7<br>Bile: C<sub>bile</sub> > Cp  |      Blood Flow      |
|      Low      |        High         | Hepatic: E < 0.7<br>Bile: C<sub>bile</sub> <= Cp |    Enzymatic Rate    |


#### **Bioavailability & Bioequivalence**
**Bioavailability**
- Quantified by [[Lecture 3.1 - (Quantitative Pharmacokinetics) Distribution & Elimination#**Models to Quantify Drug Distribution & Elimination**|AUC]]
	- Used with Dose to calculate CL in Clinical Trials
	- Determine drug absorption rate / amount / proportion from Formulations / Dosage Forms
	- Measures Relationship between Drug Cp & Clinical Efficacy / Toxicity
