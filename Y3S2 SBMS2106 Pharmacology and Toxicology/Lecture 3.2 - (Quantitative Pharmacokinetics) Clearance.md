#### **Bathtub Model of Clearance**
**Elimination & Clearance**
-  Drug Elimination (mg/hr): The amount of drug metabolized or excreted per unit time
	- Drug elimination ↑, as Cp & CL↑
- Drug Clearance (mL/hr): The volume of blood cleared from drug per unit time
	- Systemic Clearance: Sum of clearance in all eliminating organs (Hepatic + Renal + Pulmonary + Metabolic)
		- Hepatic clearance: Metabolism & Biliary Excretion
		- Renal clearance: Excretion
		- Pulmonary clearance
		- Metabolic Clearance: Drug biotransformation via enzymes

**Bathtub Model**
 - Like water elimination from bathtub ↑ as ↑ water height & ↑ plughole size
	- CL ≈ The volume of bathtub cleared from water


#### **Hepatic Clearance**
**Hepatic Extraction**
- Hepatic Extraction Rate:$$\Large Blood\;Flow(C_{A}\;-\;C_{V})$$
- Hepatic Extraction Ratio:$$\Large\frac{Blood\;Flow(C_{A}\;-\;C_{V})}{Blood\;Flow(C_{A})}$$
	- From a scale of 0-1, the amount of administrated drug that gets extracted from liver

**Hepatic Clearance**
- Hepatic Clearance = Blood Flow * Extraction Ratio
- Factors affecting ER:
- Molecular size (PPB Binding)
- Hepatic Perfusion
- Liver Capabilities
- ∴ Alterations in drug dosage are needed to prevent toxicity
