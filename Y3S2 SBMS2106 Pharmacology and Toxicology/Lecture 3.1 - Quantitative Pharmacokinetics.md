**Therapeutic Index**

- TI = <abbr Title="Toxic Dose in 50% Population">TD<sub>50</sub></abbr> / <abbr Title="Effective Dose in 50% Population">ED<sub>50</sub></abbr>


**Therapeutic Drug Monitoring (TDM)**
- Collection of Blood samples at fixed time relative to drug administration intervals
- Needed if:
	- Drug has narrow TI â†’ High Toxicity Risk
		- E.g. Digoxin, Phenytoin & Cyclosporine
	- Patient Non-compliance
	- Lack of / Not Easily Quantified Therapeutic Responses
	- Variability in Drug Dose-Concentration relationship


#### **Models to Quantify Drug Distribution & Elimination**
**Pharmacokinetic Variables**
