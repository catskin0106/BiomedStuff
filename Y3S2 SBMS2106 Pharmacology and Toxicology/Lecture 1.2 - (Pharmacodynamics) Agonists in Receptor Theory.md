#### **Receptor Affinity, Occupancy & Efficacy**
**Affinity (1/Kd)**
- The Tendency of a Ligand to bind with Receptor:
$$\Large \ce{[A][R] <=>[k1][k_{-1}] [AR]}$$
- Equilibrium: <abbr Title="[A][R]k₁">Forward Rate</abbr> = <abbr Title="[AR]k₂">Backward Rate</abbr>

| **Variable** |                   **Affected by**                   | **Value within Same Agonist Series** |
| :----------: | :-------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------: |
|      k1      | [A] Diffusion Rate<br>[A] [R] Collision Probability |               Similar                |
|      k2      |                   [AR] Stability                    |                Varies                |

- Factors affecting Collision Probability:
	- 3D Conformation of Ligand & Receptor
	- Molecular Size & Shape
	- Lipid Solubility to Cross Plasma Membrane
	- pH & Ionization


- - Equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd): Concentration at which <abbr Title="50% of the receptors are occupied">Occupancy (y) = 0.5</abbr>:
    -  Or Tendency of AR to dissociate: Kd ∝ 1 / Affinity
$$\Large Kd = \frac{k_{-1}}{k_{1}} \text{ or } \frac{[A][R]}{[AR]}$$

**Occupancy (y)**
- Fraction of the Receptors occupied:
$$\Large y = \frac{[A]}{[A] +Kd}$$
- Dimensions of Occupancy
	- Kd & [A] have dimensions of concentration (i.e. a unit)
	- y is a dimensionless ratio


**Biological Stimulus (S)**
- Total input to the transduction system from ligand-receptor binding:
	- Affected by Efficacy (e) & Occupancy (y)
$$\Large S = ey$$


#### **Full & Partial Agonists**
**Types of Functional Agonists**
- Full Agonists: Can achieve E<sub>max</sub> of 100% in <abbr Title="Concentration-Response Curve">CRC</abbr> 
	- Possibly without occupying all receptors
- Partial Agonists: With E<sub>max</sub> lower than 100%

**Explanation for Partial Agonism**

| :-------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Two Receptor System  | Partial agonist activate weaker receptor than full agonist                   |
| Functional Antagonism | Same Partial agonist can activate 2 types of receptors with opposing effects |
|       Efficacy        | Agonist has lower efficacy (possibly due to conformation)                    |
