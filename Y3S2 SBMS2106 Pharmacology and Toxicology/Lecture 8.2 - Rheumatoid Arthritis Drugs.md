#### **Rheumatoid Arthritis**
- Synovitis from Immunoresponse against Joint Tissue
	- Severe joint stiffness, swelling & deformities with pain
    - Through Pro-Inflammatory cytokines:
	    - IL-1/2
	    - TNF-α
- Causes:
	- Genetic
	- Environmental Factors
	- Acute Trigger (Trauma / Infection)
- Treatment Aim:
	- Symptom Relief
	- Lifestyle Preservation
	- Prevention of Structural Damage & Dysfunction


#### **NSAIDs**
- Pain Relief Only ([[Lecture 8.1 - Pain & Analgesics#**Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)**|Mechanism]])
	- Need Higher Dose & Longer Duration than Simple Analgesia
		- High chance of side effects (esp. GI)
		- Paracetamol: Less side effect risk but very weak anti-inflammatory effect
- Does not Alter Disease Course


#### **Slow Acting Anti-Rheumatic Drugs (SAARDs)**
**Advantages & Disadvantages of SAARDs**
- Advantages:
	- Beneficial in Progressive RA 
		- ∵ Poor response to NSAIDs
	- ↓ Pain & Swelling
	- May retard disease progress
- Disadvantages:
	- Does not completely halt RA
	- Slow-Acting: ~6 Weeks before Improvement is shown
	- Side Effects:
		- Immunodeficiency
		- Hyperglycemia & Dyslipidemia → Hypertension
		- Peptic, Liver & Kidney Injury

**Methotrexates (MTX)**
