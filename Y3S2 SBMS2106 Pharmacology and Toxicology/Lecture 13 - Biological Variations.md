#### **Key Factors Affecting Drug Actions**
- Age
- Genetics
	- Ethnicity: Genetics on a Population Scale
- Other Factors
	- Drug Interactions
	- Pathological States


#### **Age**
- Elderly are 7 times more likely to suffer from adverse drug reactions

**Pharmacokinetic Factors**
- Body Composition
	- Infants: 
		- ↑ Body Water Content → ↑ Vd for Water-soluble drugs → Undertreatment Risk
	- Elderly: 
		- ↓ Body Water Content → ↑ Initial Concentration for Water-soluble drugs → Overdose Risk
		- ↑ Body Fat Content → ↑ Vd for Lipid-soluble drugs → Undertreatment Risk
- Elimination
	- Infants & Elderly: ↓ GFR & Renal Blood Flow → ↓ Drug Metabolism & Excretion Efficiency
- Plasma Proteins
	- Elderly: ↓ Plasma Albumin → ↑ Active free drug (e.g. Phenytoin)

**Pharmacodynamic Factors**
- Elderly: ↑ Sensitivity
	- Benzodiazepines: Sedation & Confusion
	- Antihypertensive: Postural Hypotension


#### **Genetics**
- Heritable common DNA variation → Subtle alterations on protein function
