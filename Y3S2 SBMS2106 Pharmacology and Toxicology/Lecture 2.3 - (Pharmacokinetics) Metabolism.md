Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Drug Metabolism
- Factors Affecting Distribution

---
#### **Drug Metabolism**
**Fate of Drugs after Biotransformation**
- Activation of Prodrugs
	- Prodrugs have ↑ Stability & ↓ Side effects during Distribution
- Extraction of Active Metabolite from Active Drug
- Inactivation of Active Metabolites into Less Active Products


#### **Sites of Biotransformation**
**Enzymes**
- Microsomal & Non-microsomal:

| Properties             | <        | Microsomal Enzymes                                   | Non-Microsomal Enzymes |
