#### **Basic Principles of Current Anticancer Drug Therapies**
**Selective Toxicity**
- Maximal Harm to Cancer Cells & Minimal Harm to Normal Cells
	- Goal: Destroy all Malignant cells to prevent recurrence
	- Ideal scenario: A drug kills cancer cells specifically
- Requires understanding differences between cancer & normal cells

**Current Status**
- First Order Kinetics
	- Constant Fraction of cancer cells are killed with each dose â†’ Multiple rounds of therapy needed

**Current Challenges**

|        Challenge        | Description |
| :---------------------: | ----------- |
|     Low Selectivity     |             |
|     Drug Resistance     |             |
| Inter-patient Variation |             |
