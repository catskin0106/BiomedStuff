#### **Types of Receptors**

|        **Receptor**         |    **Effector**    | **Reaction Time** |
| :-------------------------: | :----------------: | :---------------: |
|  Ligand Gated Ion Channels  |    Ion Channels    |        ms         |
| G-Protein-Coupled Receptors |   Other proteins   |         s         |
|   Kinase-linked Receptors   |   Protein Kinase   |         m         |

#### **Ligand Gated Ion Channels**
**Structure of Ligand Gated Ion Channels**
- <abbr Title="Allows ionic ligands to pass through after ligand binding">Ionotropic</abbr> Channels
- 4-5 Homologous subunits (αβγδ)
	- Each subunit has a lipophilic α-helical region making 4 transmembrane domains
		- Each domain has 20-25 hydrophobic A.A.
	- Occasionally ligand binding site on subunit
		- E.g. The 2 α subunits on ACh Nicotinic receptors (Na+ channels)
