Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Drug Distribution
- Factors Affecting Distribution

---
#### **Drug Distribution**
- Drug delivery from systemic circulation to tissue
- Measured by Volume of Distribution (V):$$\Large {V = \frac{IV\;Dose\;Administrated}{Plasma\;Concentration}}$$


#### **Factors Affecting Distribution**
**Drug Factors**
- Molecular Size
- Degree of Ionization / pH
- Affinity with Tissue / Tissue-Specific Transporters

**Host Factors**
- Blood Perfusion
- Diseases altering Body Conditions
	- Body Water Distribution
	- Membrane Permeability
	- Displacement of Drug from Binding Sites
		- Binding Proteins
		- Metabolite Accumulation

**Plasma Protein Binding**

|  **Significance**  | **Description**                                                                                                                                  |     |

|        ↓ V         | Highly PPB drugs are trapped in plasma with plasma proteins<br><br>- Free drug conc. ↑ under hypoalbuminemia                                     |     |
|   Longer Acting    | PPB as Temporary Storage: Unavailable for action until more free drugs are eliminated → Prolonged effect                                         |     |
| Extracted by Liver | Can be actively extracted by active transport / kidney tubules<br><br>→ Shortened effect                                                         |     |
| Drug Displacement  | Different drugs may compete for same plasma protein<br><br>- Aspirin > Sulfonylureas (Hypoglycemia)<br>    <br>- Phenytoin > Warfarin (Toxicity) |     |
