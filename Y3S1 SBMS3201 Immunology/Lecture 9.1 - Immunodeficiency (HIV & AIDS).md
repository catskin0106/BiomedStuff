#### **Life Cycle of HIV**

|           Step            | Description                                                                                                                        |
| :-----------------------: | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|      <br>Endocytosis      | HIV Entry to CD4<sup>+</sup> Cells<br>- Major Receptor: CD4<br>- Major Co-receptors: CXCR4 (HIV-X4) & CCR5 (HIV-R5)                |
|          Fusion           | Activate viral enzymes within nucleocapsid                                                                                         |
|          Copying          | **Reverse** Transcription, Replication & Protein Synthesis using Host Machinery<br>- Highly error prone → High gp120 mutation rate |
|          Release          | Assembly, Budding and Release                                                                                                      |
| Cell-Cell<br>Transmission | Forms Virological Synapse between cells                                                                                            |

#### **Pathogenicity of HIV**
- Apoptosis of Active CD4<sup>+</sup> Cells
	- Tat interferes with Host Protein Synthesis
- <abbr Title="Inflammatory Cell Death">Pyroptosis</abbr> of Quiescent CD4<sup>+</sup> Cells during Abortive Infections
	- Low host transcription activity → Incomplete reverse transcription
	- Low antigen stimulation
- Immune Exhaustion of CD8<sup>+</sup> Cells from Chronic Immune Activation
	- HIV: High viral load & PRR Activation
	- CD8<sup>+</sup>: Growth arrest & ↓ Cytotoxic Capacity

#### **Clinical Course of HIV Disease**

| Phase             | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acute Phase       | Infection of mucosal CD4<sup>+</sup> Cells → Flu-like Acute HIV Syndrome                                                                                          |
| <br>Chronic Phase | Anti-HIV Antibody & CD8<sup>+</sup> Development → Virus production partially controlled<br>Continuous Viral Replication → Progressive lymphoid tissue destruction |
| <br><br>AIDS      | Opportunistic Infection: Infection by many pathogens<br>Wasting Disease<br>Viral-Associated Tumors<br>CNS Degradation                                             |

#### **Therapy for HIV Disease**
- Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART)
	- More than 25 Licensed Drugs

**Mechanisms**
- Inhibit:
	- Entry & Fusion
	- Reverse Transcription
	- Protease for Viral Assembly

**Limitations**
- Viral reservoir is still stable
- Not in the Gut
- Need Continuous Intake
- Drug Resistance
	- ∵ Poor Adherence
