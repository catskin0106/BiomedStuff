#### **Immunological Tolerance**
- A State of induced immuno-unresponsiveness to protect host from anti-self immunoresponses
	- Induced by antigens called Toleragens
	- Dysregulation leads to Autoimmune diseases or Immunodeficiency

**Establishment of Tolerance**

| Tolerance  | Purpose                        | Time Established        | Location Established       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Central    | Self & Non-self Discrimination | Lymphocyte Early Stages | Primary Lymphoid Organs    |
| Peripheral | Prevent overreactivity         | Lymphocyte Later Stages | Peripheral Lymphoid Organs |

**Immunological Tolerance Mechanisms**
- Clonal Deletion
	- Central Tolerance: Deletion of self-reactive cells in Primary Lymphoid Organs
	- Peripheral Tolerance: Deletion / Anergy of self-reactive cells in Peripheral Tissues
- Clonal Anergy
	- T Cells: No co-stimulation
		- ∵ TCR Complex signaling blockage (CTLA-4) / Inhibitory Receptors (PD-1)
	- B Cells: No 3 Activation Signals
		- No BCR cross-linkage
		- No linked recognition of self-antigen → No CD40-CD40L co-stimulation
			- ∵ Self-reactive T cells already -ve selected in the thymus
- Immunosuppression from Treg
	- Mechanisms:
		- Competition for Growth Factor (IL-2)
			- CD25 (High affinity IL-2R) on Treg competes for IL-2 against effector T cells
			- → Suppress effector T cells activation
		- Release of Suppressive Cytokines (IL-10,35 & TGF-β)
			- → Suppress effector T cells & APC
		- Metabolic Modulation
			- Release Adenosine
			- Activate Arginase & <abbr Title="Indolamine 2,3-Dioxygenase">IDO</abbr> in DCs
				- Depletes Arginine & Tryptophan for Oxidative Phosphorylation
		- Induction of Cytolysis
	- Targets:
		- Acts on immune cells that responds to their cognate antigen
		- Linked immunosuppression
			- Can spread to other antigens
				- when APC engages simultaneously with T cells of different specificity



#### **Transplantation Immunology**
- <abbr Title="Self Transplantation">Autograft</abbr>, <abbr Title="Transplantation between Genetically Identical Individuals">Isograft</abbr>, <abbr Title="Transplantation between Genetically Different Individuals">Allograft</abbr> & <abbr Title="Transplantation between Different Species">Xenograft</abbr>
- Recipient Survival depends on:
	- Transferred tissue availability & health
	- Immune system status

**Graft Rejection Mechanism**
- ABO Blood Group Mismatch: Antibody Mediated Cytolysis
	- Natural Antibodies (Anti-A/B) lyse donor cells with alloantigen A/B
- MHC Antigen Mismatch
	- Direct Alloantigen Recognition

| Step | Process                                                                  |

|  2   | Cytotoxicity by CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells                                  |

	- Indirect Alloantigen Recognition

| Step | Process                                                                                                                                 |
| :--: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1   | Recipient DCs/Macrophage take up MHC alloantigen from graft cells                                                                       |
|  2   | Recipient DCs present alloantigen to TCR<br>- Form Self MHC-Peptide Complex                                                             |
|  3   | B Cell release antibodies from CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells activation<br>Inflammatory damage from CD4<sup>+</sup> activation by Macrophages |

**Graft Rejection Prevention**
- Blood group matching
- MHC matching
- Cross-matching
- Immunosuppressive Therapies
	- Generalized: Block lymphocyte mitosis / signaling
	- Specific: Block specific co-simulation / cytokines / cell types


#### **Autoimmunity**
- Direct / Indirect attack on own cells due to lost immunotolerance

**Factors leading to Autoimmunity**
- Defective Self-Tolerance
	- Inadequate T/B Cell Elimination / Regulation
- Abnormal Self-Antigen Presenting
	- Increased expression / persistence of Self-Antigen
	- Structural changes from enzymatic modifications


#### **Autoimmunity Diseases**
**Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus**
- Organ-Specific
- Destruction of β cell of the pancreas by T cells
	- Lost of insulin production

**Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Lupus)**
- Systemic
- Production of antibodies against <abbr Title="e.g. Nuclear proteins">Common Cell Components</abbr>
	- Type III hypersensitivity: Organ failure from immunity complexes blocking blood vessels

**Rheumatoid Arthritis**
- Systemic
- Production of antibodies against Citrullinated Protein Agents / <abbr Title="aka Rheumatoid Factor">AFc region of IgG</abbr>
	- Joint destruction (via Complement) from Immunity complex deposits in joints

**Current Therapies in Autoimmune Diseases**
- Broad-spectrum immunosuppression
	- T/B Cell Depletion
- Specific immunosuppression
	- Targets trafficking/adhesion
	- Targets TCR/Cytokine/Co-stimulation
- Targeted immunotherapy
