#### **Cancer Immune Escape**
- Strategy to Evade Host Immunoresponses for Growth

**Intrinsic Mechanisms**
- Loss of Antigen / Presentation
	- MHC-I Down-regulation'
- Anti-Apoptotic Signals

**Immunosuppression Mechanisms**
- Heterogenicity in Constitution
	- Genetic / Antigen Variation in same tumor
- Enhancement of Immunosuppressive Metabolism
- T-Cell Functional Exhaustion
	- By Tumor Cell Ligands binding to Immune Checkpoints (in B7-CD28 Superfamily) on T Cells
	- Activate Immunosuppressive Pathways (PD1/PD-L1)
- Impairment of <abbr Title="Trafficking of T Cells">Chemotaxis</abbr> into <abbr Title="Tumor Microenvironment">TME</abbr>
	- Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells (MDSCs)
	- Tumor-Associated Macrophages (TAM)
	- Treg


#### **Cancer Immunotherapy**
- Restore Productive Immunosurveillance
	- Diversity of receptors → High Capacity for Specificity
	- Diversity of cell-killing weaponry → Potential to kill any Malignant Cell

**Cancer Vaccines**
- Instruct Host Immune System to Recognize Cancer
	- Mainly Targets Virus-related Cancers (e.g. HPV-Driven Cervical Cancer)
	- Sipuleucel-T: For Advanced hormone-resistant prostate cancer
- Considerations:
	- TAA to Target
	- Adjuvant / Platform for Delivery
	- Ex/In Vivo DC Targeting

**Adaptive Cell Transfer (ACT) Therapy**
- Transfer of autologous DCs to recipient
	- Patient-derived T Cells
	- Engineered T Cells
	- CAR-T

**Immune Checkpoint Blockade (ICB) Therapy**
- Block Immune Checkpoints that maintain self-tolerance through immunosuppression:
	- CTLA-4 Binds to B7-1 & B7-2 in Lymphoid Tissues
	- PD-1 Binds to PD-L1 in Peripheral Tissues
- Nivolumab (Anti PD-1)
	- Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): Resistance in 80% Advanced Patients
