#### **Overview of Infectious Diseases**
**Properties**
- Mechanisms of Causing Illnesses:
	- Toxins
	- Resource Hijack by Reproduction
	- Inflammation
- Mostly RNA Viruses
	- Higher mutation rate
- Mostly Zoonotic
	- Cross-Species Spillover Infections (e.g. Bat to Human)

**Modes of Transmission**
- General Transmission
	- Abiotic: Wind, Water
	- Animal Vectors: Arthropod Bite
- Human to Human Transmission
	- Direct Contact
	- Indirect Contact: Picked up from surfaces
	- Droplets
	- Airborne
	- Fecal-Oral: Food Contamination
	- Sexual Exposure



#### **Influenza**
**Influenza Properties**
- -ve sense ssRNA virus
- 4 Types (A-D)
	- A & B: Cause Seasonal Epidemics
	- A: Caused Pandemics
- Surface Glycoproteins: Hemagglutinin (HA) & Neuraminidase (NA)
	- Can bind to Sialic Acid (SA) of Host cells

**Influenza Pathogenecity**
- Pathogenicity: HA prefers SA of Pulmonary Epithelial Cells
	- Can be blocked by Tamiflu (Oseltamivir)
- Transmission Cycles: Mixing Vessel Theory
	- Swine is common host for Avian & Human influenza A viruses
	- → Novel virus with pandemic potential from mixing Influenza genes

**Influenza Life Cycle**

|    Step     | Description                                                         |
| :---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Endocytosis | HA Binds to SA of Host Entry Receptor<br>- Mediates Entry & Fusion  |
|   Fusion    | Endosome Acidifies for Uncoating under low pH                       |
|  Uncoating  | Releases RNA                                                        |
|   Copying   | Transcription, Replication & Protein Synthesis using Host Machinery |
|   Release   | Assembly, Budding and Release<br>- Released from NA cleaving SA     |
**Immunoresponses against Influenza**
- Antibody Response

|   Response Type    | Involved Lymphocytes                                                                      |
| :----------------: | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  Primary Response  | Activated: Naïve B cells                                                                  |
| Secondary Response | Activated: Memory B cells<br>Inhibited: Naïve B cells (Inhibited by preformed antibodies) |
**Influenza Immune Escape**
- Causes:
	- Antigenic Shift
		- New viral subtype from reassortment of viral genomes
		- → Antigenic potential changes
	- Antigenic Drift
		- HA & NA changes due to accumulating mutations
		- → Escapes antibody responses
	- Original Antigenic Sin
		- Immune system prefers deploying memory over naïve cells for pathogens with memorized epitopes
		- → No memorization of new epitopes in subsequent infections of same pathogen from antigenic shift & drift
- Consequence: 
	- Gradually weakening Secondary Responses
	- No Secondary Response once all old epitopes are absent in the pathogen
- Remedy: Seasonal Vaccinations


#### **Coronaviruses**
**Coronavirus Properties**
- +ve sense ssRNA virus
- 4 Generas (αβγδ)
	- β: MERS, Both SARS
- Surface Proteins: Spike (S) Glycoproteins
	- Has S<sub>1</sub> & S<sub>2</sub> subunits

**SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenicity** 
- Cytotoxicity on Respiratory Tract & Extrapulmonary Tissues
	- ↑ Angiotensin II → Inflammation & Vasoconstriction
		- ∵ SARS-CoV-2 downregulates ACE2 which degrades Ang II
	- Endothelial Cell Dysfunction
		- Direct Infection
		- Dysregulated Immunoresponses


**SARS-CoV-2 Life Cycle**

|    Step     | Description                                                         |
| :---------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Endocytosis | S<sub>1</sub> Head Binds to ACE2 on Host surface                    |
|   Fusion    | S<sub>2</sub> Facilitates Viral & Host membrane fusion              |
|  Uncoating  | Releases RNA                                                        |
|   Copying   | Transcription, Replication & Protein Synthesis using Host Machinery |
|   Release   | Assembly, Budding and Release                                       |
**Immunoresponses against SARS-CoV-2**

| Differences      | Influenza A    | SARS-CoV-2                   |
| ---------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Virus Type       | -ve ssRNA      | +ve ssRNA                    |
| Fusion Mechanism | HA Binds to SA | S Glycoprotein binds to ACE2 |
