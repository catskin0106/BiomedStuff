- Links genotype and phenotype
	- Forward Genetics: Phenotype → Genotype (Association Mapping)
	- Reverse Genetics: Genotype → Phenotype (Genetic Engineering)

#### **Functional Analyses of Genomic Sequencing Data**
- SNP Functional Characterization

| Step | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Lead SNP Identification                                                                                       |
| 2    | Check SNP Coding / Non-coding<br>- Coding: Easily assigned<br>- Non-coding: Establish what gene it influences |
| 3    | Determine Cell type it is active in                                                                           |
| 4    | Evaluate functional role (e.g. Regulatory as binding site)                                                    |
| 5    | Connect disease with SNP related function / pathway                                                           |

- Differentially expressed gene identification

| Step | Description                                                                                                   | Tools |
