#### **Bioinformatics Practices and Resources**
**Golden Rules for Bioinformatics Analysis**
- Use published tools for higher reliability
- Read manuals for proper uses & limitations
- Look for information useful for result interpretation
- Use multiple tools for cross-validation
- Quality of data is paramount (GIGO)
