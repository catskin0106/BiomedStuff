#### **Purpose of Cancer Cell Culturing**
- To grow cancer cells
	- Subculturing helps prevent overpopulation of cancer cells
	- Well plate seeding prepares cancer cells for experiments


#### **Steps of Cancer Cell Culturing**
**1. Making Culture Media**
- Defrost FBS (<abbr Title="Usually 50mL">10%</abbr>) & Antibiotics (<abbr Title="Usually 5mL">1%</abbr>) & Mix into <abbr Title="Usually 500mL">DMEM</abbr>

**2. Check Cancer Cell Confluence**
- If high (80-90%) then do Subculture, If low then proceed

**3. Change Media**
- Aspirate original media slowly with funni 25mL pipette
	- → Inject 8-10mL new media with funni pipette to the side of the plate gently
	- **!! Minimize the exposure of cells to air !! (By opening the lid only by little)**

- Use parafilm to seal the culture media
	- → Close the fume hood


#### **Steps of Cancer Cell Subculture**
**1. Trypsinization**
- Aspirate original media slowly with pipette
	- → Wash with PBS twice
	- → Add 1mL Trypsin & Incubate in 37°C for 3 mins

**2. Cell Extraction**
- Add 1mL culture media to stop trypsinization
	- → Check if trypsinization is successful
- Add everything to centrifuge tube
- Centrifuge at 1000rpm for 4 minutes
	- → **!!DISCARD SUPERNATANT!!**

**3. Resuspension**
- Add 1mL medium & resuspend pellet by mixing up & down
	- → See add how many to each plate la should be basic math
	- e.g. 20% then add 0.2mL

**4. Add Culture Media**
- Add culture media with funni pipette until the plate has 8-10mL volume

- !!!Use parafilm to seal the culture media!!!
	- → Disinfect Close the fume hood


#### **Steps of Seeding Cancer Cell onto Well Plate**
**1. Cell Quantification**
- Resuspend Pellet in 1mL medium after Centrifugation
- Mix 10μL cell with 10μL dye
	- → Pipette into Hemocytometer and Count the Sum of Any 3 Big Quadrants

**2. Calculation**
- Calculate Cell Contraction per mL: 
	- x is the sum of cells in any 3 Big Quadrants

$$
Density(D) = \frac{2x}{3}*10^{4}\,\,(cells/mL)
$$
- Calculate the amount of suspension needed to extract 100000 cells:
	- → Add the suspension to culture dish

$$
\frac{100000}{D}
$$
- Calculate the amount of <abbr Title="Cell suspension + DMEM">solution</abbr> needed in each well (<abbr Title="x4 if 6cm dish; x1/4 if 96-well plate">400μL in each of 24-well plates)</abbr>:
	- For 96-well plates, <abbr Title="25k for 24-well plates; 100k for 6cm dishes">6250 cells</abbr> are needed in each of the 60 wells:

$$
\frac{6250}{D} (mL\,of\,cell\,suspension\,in\,each\,well)
$$
- Fill the remainder with DMEM
	- (e.g. if 20μL cell suspension, then add 80μL DMEM)

**3. Seeding**
- Seed 100μL into every plate not on the edge
- Fill 100μL PBS into the edge wells
