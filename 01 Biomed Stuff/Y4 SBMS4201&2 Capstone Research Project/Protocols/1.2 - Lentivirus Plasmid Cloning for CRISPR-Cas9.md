#### **Purpose of Lentivirus Plasmid Cloning**
- To insert genes for gRNA and/or Cas9 production into the lentiviral plasmid
	- Enable gene editing in mammalian cells through lentiviral infection


#### **Steps of Lentivirus Plasmid Cloning**
**1. Vector Digestion & Dephosphorylation**
- Add reagents with descending order by volume

| Reagents               | Notes                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 5μL Plasmid            |                            |
| 1μL Restriction Enzyme | BsmBI                      |
| 1μL Phosphatase        | Alkaline Phosphatase       |
| 4μL Buffer (10x)       |                            |
| Total 40μL             | Fill with ddH<sub>2</sub>O |
- Store at 37°C for 4hrs

**2. Make Insert**

| Reagents                 | Notes                      |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1μL Forward Primer       |                            |
| 1μL Backward Primer      |                            |
| 1μL PNK                  |                            |
| 5μL Ligation Buffer (2x) |                            |
| Total 10μL               | Fill with ddH<sub>2</sub>O |
- Store at 37°C for 30min (Preheat Thermocycler at 15th min)
	- → 95°C for 5 min → Cool down at room temp. → Store at -20°C

**3. Gel Purification**

| Reagents     | Notes                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| TAE          | 20mL                                                        |
| Agarose (?%) | Calculate in relation to TAE and concentration (Usually 1%) |

- Microwave for 1-2 mins then cool until about 40-50°C
	- → Add 2μL GelRed (10000x) (Reheat and readd GelRed if it fails to dissolve)
	- → Store in Darkness until it solidifies

- Add loading dye to negative control & digested plasmid (**DONT ADD TO DNA LADDER**)
	- → Load negative control, DNA ladder and **ALL OF** digested plasmid sample into gel wells
	- → Run gel electrophoresis for 25 mins (Red to Black)

- Cut <abbr Title="under UV">bright bands</abbr> with a scalpel (**minimize UV exposure**) & Measure Volume before Transporting into tube
	- → Add Solution Buffer such that Solution buffer : Gel = <abbr Title="If gel=100mg, buffer=400μL">4:1</abbr>
	- → Incubate at 50°C until fully dissolves

 - Pour into adsorption column & Centrifuge 12k RPM 1 min (**REMEMBER TO BALANCE & CLOSE THE LIDSSSS**)
	- Repeat until sample is used up
	- → **TWICE**: Add 200μL DNA wash and Centrifuge 12k RPM 1 min
	- → Add 20μL ddH<sub>2</sub>O & Centrifuge 7k RPM 1 min for Elution


**4. Ligation**
- Dilute the Insert oligo for <abbr Title="Usually 1μL sample to 199μL ddH2O">1:200</abbr> first

| Reagents                   | Notes                                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 2μL BsmBI digested Plasmid | From Step 3                            |
| 1μL **Diluted** Oligo      | From Step 2                            |
| 1μL Ligase                 |                                        |
| 5μL Ligation Buffer (2x)   |                                        |
| Total 10μL                 | Fill with ddH<sub>2</sub>O in PCR Tube |
- Wait for 1-2 hours for Ligation


**5. Transformation**
- Add Transformed Plasmid to Bacteria
	- → Ice for 20 min → 45°C for 1.5 min for heat shock → Ice for 2 min

- Add 1mL <abbr Title="Luria Broth">LB</abbr> (without Penicillin)
	- → Shake in 37°C for 1 hour

- Centrifuge 3.75k RPM for 3 minutes
	- → Discard suspension until only about ~100μL remains
	- → Resuspend pellet until no pellet is seen
	- → Drop solution on agar plate

- Suspend the streaking fork(?) in ethanol then burn it to kill bacteria (**DO THIS BEFORE EVERY STREAK**)
	- → Gently spread the solution to all around the plate
	- → Wait 5-10 minutes until dry

- Incubate for 37°C **upside down**

**6. Selection**
- Add 1mL of LB (with Penicillin) to each tube
	- → Add 1 colony to 1 tube
	- → Shake in 37°C overnight

- If the solution becomes muddy, Extract 200μL from each tube to another tube for sequencing
