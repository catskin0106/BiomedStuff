#### **Steps of IHC Staining**
**1. Deparaffinization**
- Deparaffinize & Rehydrate tissue section originally fixed by formalin & embedded in paraffin

**2. Dilution (Can be done during 3. Incubation)**
- (Day 1) Dilute Primary Antibody: 50μL per sample with <abbr Title="Antibody">1</abbr> : <abbr Title="Protein Block">50/100</abbr>
	- If 1:50: Add 1μL Antibody & 49μL Protein Block per sample
	- If 1:100: Add 0.5μL Antibody & 49.5μL Protein Block per sample

- (Day 2) Dilute DAB: 50μL per sample with <abbr Title="DAB Chromogen">1</abbr> : <abbr Title="DAB Substrate">50</abbr>
	- Add 1μL DAB Chromogen & 49μL Substrate per sample

**3. Reagent Application**
- Add indicated amount of reagents then incubate for specified duration in order

| Order |          Reagent           |            Amount            |       Incubation Time       | Rinse                   |
| ----- | :------------------------: | :--------------------------: | :-------------------------: | ----------------------- |
| 1     |     Hydrogen Peroxide      | Until Slide is Fully Covered |         10 minutes          | After: 2x               |
| 2     |       Protein Block        | Until Slide is Fully Covered |         10 minutes          | After: 1x               |
| 3     | Primary Antibody (Diluted) |       50μL Each Sample       | Overnight<br>(In Cold Room) | ?                       |
| 4     |     Secondary Antibody     | Until Slide is Fully Covered |         10 minutes          | Before: 4x<br>After: 4x |
| 5     |       DAB (Diluted)        |       50μL Each Sample       |        1-10 minutes         | Before: 4x<br>After: 4x |
**4. Counterstaining**
- Open water tab in sink
	- → *Quickly* dip in <abbr Title="Not the one next to the sink; The one in the microtome room cabinet">Hematoxylin</abbr>
	- → Wash in Water Bath 1 min

**5. DCM**
- Balance slides on two ends of the rack, with the samples facing "Up"
	- → DCM DAB only on the machine
- Clear for 2 mins
	- → Soak in Xylene for 1-2 minutes (x3)
- Check if cover slides are clean
	- → Add *small amount* of mounting medium to slide
	- → Tilt the sample slide and slowly stick it to cover slide
	- → Push bubbles (Not with the tip of the forceps)
