#### **Evaluation of AI in Research**
**Potential Applications**
- Image Recognition: Rapid Identification & Quantification of Histological Features from Own Samples
- Prediction of Molecular Interactions

**Implementation Methods**
- Finetuning: Tweaking the final layer(s) of already existing architectures → Allow it to perform more specific tasks
	- Fastest, High Accuracy & Least GPU demand
	- Usage of architectures developed by others → Copyright; Unable to publish paper
	- Unable to learn about the principles of AI architecture
		- Can't debug in case the AI goes wrong
- We ball: Develop an architecture from scratch
	- Slowest, Low Accuracy & High GPU demand
	- Original architecture → No Copyright issues
	- More comprehensive understanding about AI architecture
		- Requires Trial & Error but allows debugging

**Development of Architecture**
- From easiest to hardest in terms of implementation difficulty
	- 1. kNN model
	- 2. Connected Neural Network
	- 3. Convolutional Neural Networks
