Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Attention

---
#### **Attention**
**Definition**
- Selectively Allocation of Limited Neural Resources
	- → Process specific information
	- → Suppressing other concurrently available information

**Purpose**
- Finer analysis of relevant & <abbr Title="Visually Conspicuous">salient</abbr> stimuli with limited brain processing capacity
- Construct conscious perception from allocating attention on sensory "fragments"
	- e.g. Change Blindness: Visual scene changes are unnoticed unless attended to

#### **Biased Competition Model**
- Competition for Neural Representation & Processing Resources between Endogenous & Exogenous Attention
- Competition Result reflected by <abbr Title="Temporoparietal Junction">TPJ</abbr> & <abbr Title="Ventral Frontal Cortex">VFC</abbr>
	- Damage can lead to Neglect (e.g. Unilateral Damage → Hemispatial Neglect)

**Types of Attention**

|  Type of Attention   |                             Endogenous<br>(Volitional / Top-Down)                             |               Exogenous<br>(Automatic / Bottom-Up)                |

|      Defintion       |              Consciously directing attention to stimuli based on internal goals               | Unconsciously directing attention to salient / surprising stimuli |
|        Origin        | <abbr Title="Superior Parietal Lobe">SPL</abbr> & <abbr Title="Frontal Eye Fields">FEF</abbr> |                          Sensory Stimuli                          |
| Effect on V4 Neurons |                                       Enhances Response                                       |                       Suppresses Responses                        |
| Examples in Saccades |                         Explicit Instructions alter Saccadic Patterns                         |        Saccades often Fixate on Salient Feature like Faces        |
