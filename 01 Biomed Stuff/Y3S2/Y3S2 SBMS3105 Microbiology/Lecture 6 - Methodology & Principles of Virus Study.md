#### **Laboratory Detection of Virus**
- Purposes:
	- Diagnosis: Detection of Viral Morphology / Antigen / Antibody / Gene
	- Isolation: For Research / Testing

**Microscopy (Morphology Detection)**

|    Microscopy Type     | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| :--------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|    Light Microscopy    | Detect Virus-Induced Cytopathic Effects (Inclusion Bodies):<br>- Can't resolve virions (Antigen Visualization by Immunoperoxidase Staining) |
|  Electron Microscopy   | Electron Beams:<br>- Visualize Morphology in High Magnification<br>- ↑ Cost<br>- ↓ Sensitivity & Specificity (Improved by Immuno-EM)        |
| Fluorescent Microscopy | Direct Immunofluorescence:<br>- Viral Antigen Detection in Clinical Samples                                                                 |

**Antigen Detection**
- Detects viral protein in sample
	- <abbr Title="Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay">ELISA</abbr>
	- Immunochromatography
		- <abbr Title="Rapid Antigen Test">RAT</abbr>: <abbr Title="Hepatitis B surface Antigen">HBsAg</abbr> / HIV

**Antibody Detection**
- Detects host antibody production to infection
	- ELISA
	- Flow-Through Assays
- IgG & IgM levels reflect infection recency:

| Antibody Level     | Indication                             |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| IgM + 4x IgG titer | Recent Infection                       |
| IgG Presence       | Chronic / Past Infection & Vaccination |

**Molecular Diagnostics (Gene Detection)**
- ↑ Sensitivity, Specificity & Efficiency

| Technique           | Description                                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PCR / RT-PCR        | Amplifies viral DNA / RNA for detection<br>- RT-PCR allows Quantification |
| Nucleic Acid Probes | Detects viral genomes via Hybridization                                   |
| Genomic Sequencing  | Identifies Virus Variant & Track Transmission                             |

**Culture (Virus Isolation)**
- Culture → Detection
- Culture Methods:
	- Inoculation of Embryonated Egg / Animal
	- Tissue / Cell Culture
- Detection Methods:
	- Plaque Assays: Measures <abbr Title="Plaque Forming Units">pfu</abbr>
	- <abbr Title="50% Tissue Culture Infectious Dose">TCID<sub>50</sub></abbr> Assays: Replication Kinetics are represented by One-Step Growth Curves


#### **Safety in Virus Study**
**Risks**
- Infection, Contamination & Security Breaches
	- Personnel are classified with Risk Group
		- RG1 to RG4
	- Environments are classified with Biohazard Safety Level
		- BSL1 to BSL4

**Risk Management**
- Hazard Identification → Risk Assessment → Risk Management Strategies
	- Priority: Elimination / Substitution > Engineering Controls > Administration Controls > <abbr Title="Personal Protective Equipment">PPE</abbr>


#### **Virus as Gene Delivery Vector**
- Uses modified virus as vehicles to deliver genetic material
	- For Research & Gene Therapy

**Types of Virus Used**
- <abbr Title="Adeno-Associated Virus">AAV</abbr>: Small non-integrating ssRNA virus
	- Recombinant AAV produced by replacing viral genes with gene of interest + Rep/Cap/helper genes
	- Used in *in vivo* & clinical trials
	- BSL 1-2
- <abbr Title="HIV-based: Infects Dividing & Non-Dividing Cells">Lentivirus</abbr> / <abbr Title="γ Retrovirus: Infects Dividing Cells">Retrovirus</abbr>: Integrating RNA viruses
	- Used in *ex vivo* & research
	- BSL 2
