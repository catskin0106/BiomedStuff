Lecture Notes

**Lecture Coverage:**
- Age
- Genetics
- Pathogens

---
#### **Age**
**Carcinogenicity of Age**
- DNA Damage Accumulation
	- → Genomic & Epigenetic Alteration


#### **Genetics**
- Hereditary Cancer: Caused by an inherited gene mutation
- Familial Cancer: Occurs more frequently but shows no mutation inheritance


#### **Pathogens**
- Can be caused by H. Pylori, <abbr Title="Human Papillomavirus">HPV</abbr> & Hepatitis (B, C) Virus
- Opportunistic Infection by Streptococcus Anginosus

**Carcinogenicity of H. Pylori**
- Linked Hallmarks:
	- Chronic Inflammation
	- Oncogene Activation & Tumor Suppressor Loss
	- Microbiome Eradication
- Progression:
	- Chronic Gastritis → Atrophy → Intestinal Metaplasia & Dysplasia → Cancer

**Carcinogenicity of S. Anginosus**
- S. Anginosus Adhesin TMPC binding to Gastric Epithelium ANXA2 Receptor
	- → Parietal Cell Atrophy & Mucinous Metaplasia in <abbr Title="No microbiome in body">Germ-Free</abbr> Mice
- Progression:
	- Same as H. Pylori

**Carcinogenicity of Hepatitis Virus**
- Linked Hallmarks:
	- Chronic Inflammation
	- Oncogene Activation
	- Viral DNA Integration → Genomic Instability

**Carcinogenicity of HPV**
- Causes almost all Cervical Cancer
