#### **Cell Cycle Genes in Human Cancer**
**Molecular Basis of Cancer**
- Genetic Disease
	- Multiple cellular-level genetic changes
	- Transformation from <abbr Title="Tightly regulated normal genes for growth & proliferation">Proto-oncogenes</abbr> to <abbr Title="Genes that endows cells with self-sufficiency in growth">Oncogenes</abbr> through Mutation, Translocation & Amplification
- Tumors from Monoclonal Proliferation
	- All tumor cells originates from 1 single Ancestral Cell
- Accumulation of Non-lethal Damage / Mutation
	- Key Genetic <abbr Title="Mutations that Confer Selection Advantages (Antonym: Passenger Mutations)">Driver Mutations</abbr> that alters normal control mechanisms of cell physiology
	- Passed onto somatic daughter cells → Progressive Neoplastic Transformation

**Loss of Cell Cycle Control in Cancer Cells**
- Inability to Regulate Cell Cycle
	- Loss reactivity to regulatory components
	- Loss of DNA damage Checkpoints
- Uncontrolled Cell Division
	- No longer require GFs to reproduce
- Unusually Rapid Reproduction

**Cancer Treatments Targeting Cancer Cell Cycle**
- DNA Replication Stress
	- Chemotherapy: Induce Replication Stress
	- CDK4/6<abbr Title="Inhibitor">i</abbr>: Forces Cell Cycle Exit
	- ATRi: Impairs Tolerance to Replication Stress
- DNA Damage
	- Radiotherapy & Chemotherapy
- Mitotic Defects
	- Taxanes
- Genomic Instability


#### **Cell Cycle Studies**
**Purpose of Cell Cycle Studies**
- Measure DNA Content in Cell population & Assay for Cell Cycle State
	- ∴ Quantitative Analysis of Treatment Effect on Cell Proliferation / Cycle Progression


**Methods of Cell Cycle Studies**
- Flow Cytometry
	- Uses Fluorescent DNA staining dye
		- e.g. Propidium Iodide (Excited at 488nm)
	- Level of fluorescence determines DNA content & thus cell stage

- Nucleoside Analog Incorporation
	- Detects S-Phase Cells in Proliferation
		- Measures Thymidine nucleoside analog incorporation into newly synthesized DNA
	- Types of Nucleoside Analogs:
		- <abbr Title="Bromodeoxyuridine">BrdU</abbr>: Quantified with Antibodies
		- <abbr Title="Ethynyldeoxyuridine">EdU</abbr>: Quantified with Fluorescent Dye (<abbr Title="Colorimetric">Biotin</abbr> / <abbr Title="Fluorometric">Streptavidin</abbr>)
