#### **Cancer Prevention**
**Cancer Prevention Strategies / Directions**
- Prevention
	- Design Effective Preventive Strategies
	- Recognize cancer predispositions
	- Detect precursor lesions / molecular tissue changes
- Target
	- ↑ Treatment Specificity / Therapeutic Margin
	- Delineate Heterogenous Pathogenesis
- Safety
	- Protect Patients from Treatment Adverse Effects

**Modalities for Prevention**
- Behavioral
	- Nutritional
	- Carcinogen Exposure
- Hormonal
- Pharmalogical (Chemoprevention)
- Immunological (Vaccination)

**NCI Development of Cancer Prevention**
- Biomarker Development & Validation
- Clinical & Epidemiological Studies
- Informatics
- Collaborative Groups for Each Organ


#### **Chemoprevention**
- ↓ Carcinogen Impact → Treat Precancers / Mitigate Precancer Risk

**Aspirin**
- NSAID → ↓ [[Lecture 8.1 - Pain & Analgesics|PG Synthesis by COX]] → ↓ Inflammation from Multiple signaling pathways
	- Affects Cancer cells, Immune cells, Stromal cells
- Adverse Effects:
	- GI Ulcers → Perforation & Hemorrhage
		- Prevented with [[Lecture 9.1 - (Gastrointestinal Pharmacology) Gastric Ulcer Drugs|PPIs]]
	- Platelet COX-1 Inhibition → ↑ Hemorrhagic Stroke / Bleeding
		- Prevented with low dosage
	- ↑ Leukotriene → <abbr Title="Aspirin-Exacerbated Respiratory Disease">AERD</abbr> → Aspirin-Sensitive Asthma & Nasal Polyps
		- Avoid in NSAID-Hypersensitive people
		- Alternatives: Paracetamol / <abbr Title="COX-2 Selective Inhibitors">Celecoxib</abbr>
	- ↓ PG → Dysregulated Renal Perfusion → [[Lecture 2.7 (Renal System) - Other Diseases of the Urinary System|AKI & CKD]]
		- Avoid in CKD Patients
		- Monitor User Creatinine Level

**Metformin**
- ↓ <abbr Title="AMP-Activated Kinase">AMPK</abbr> Signaling → ↓ Glycogenesis in Cancer Cell Growth
- ↓ IGF-1 → ↓ Cancer Promoting Effects
- Genetic Reprogramming
	- Metabolic Alterations: ↓ Cancer cell adaptability to stress
	- Epigenetic Alterations: Regulate cell cycle arrest & apoptosis genes

**Other Chemopreventive Agents**
- Statins: ↓ Colorectal, Prostate & Breast Cancer
- Tamoxifen & Raloxifene: <abbr Title="Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators">SERMs</abbr> for ↓ Breast Cancer
- Vitamin D: Regulate Cell Differentiation & Apoptosis


#### **Vaccination Prevention**
**Preventive Vaccines**
- HPV: Prevents Oral Infections, Cervical Precancers
	- More Effective at Young Age
- HBV: Contains <abbr Title="Hepatitis B Surface Antigen">HBsAg</abbr> to stimulate long term immunoresponse
- <abbr Title="Epstein-Barr Virus">EBV</abbr>: Prevents Nasopharyngeal, Gastric Cancer & Lymphoma
- H. Pylori: Prevents Gastric Cancer

**Therapeutic Vaccines**
- Neoantigen vaccines targeting early malignancies


#### **Cancer Screening**
- Checking for Cancer in Asymptomatic People
- Types of Cancer Screening Tests:
	- Imaging-Based Screening
	- Laboratory Tests for Biomarkers
	- Genetic & Molecular Screening

**Breast Cancer Screening**
- Mammogram: Low-Dose X-Ray of Breast in Compression
- BRCA1/BRCA2: Genetic Screening for Breast / Ovarian Cancer Risk

**Cervical Cancer Screening**
- Pap test: Cervix cell collection for identifying abnormal cell changes

**Colorectal Cancer Screening**
- <abbr Title="Fecal Occult Blood Test">FOBT</abbr>: Testing kit to find normally unseen blood
- Colonoscopy: Connect camera to colon tube to look for polyps

**Prostate Cancer Screening**
- <abbr Title="Prostate Specific Antigen">PSA</abbr> Test:
	- Normal Plasma Level: 4.0 ng/mL
- <abbr Title="Prostate Cancer Gene 3">PCA3</abbr> Test:
	- <abbr Title="Long Non-Coding RNA">LncRNA</abbr> with 100x increase in Prostate tumor tissues
