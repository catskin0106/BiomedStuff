#### **Immunology of Vaccination**
- Goal: Mimic Natural Infection without Causing Disease
	- Exploit Specificity & Memory of Adaptive Immunity to provide Immunity without Causing Disease

|    Immunity Mechanism    | Description                                                                                                                      |

|          Memory          | Production of Memory B & T Cells                                                                                                 |
|  Cellular Immunity (T)   | CTL & NK T Cells kill pathogens                                                                                                  |
| <br>Humoral Immunity (B) | B Cells Activated by Helper T Cells â†’ Produce Antibodies<br>- Primary Response: IgM then IgG<br>- Secondary Response: Mainly IgG |
