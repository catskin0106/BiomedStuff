- Control of Viral Diseases

---
#### **Classification of Viral Diseases**
- Transmission Routes
	- Direct (Droplets, Contact, Body Fluid)
	- Indirect (Airborne, Vector-borne)
- Epidemiology
	- Endemic, Epidemic & Pandemic
- Primary Systems Affected
	- Dermotropic, Pneumotropic, Viscerotropic etc.


#### **Pathogenesis of Viral Diseases**
- [[Lecture 5 - Overview of Virus#**Virus Pathogenesis**|Lecture 5 - Overview of Virus]]


#### **Diagnosis of Viral Diseases**
- [[Lecture 6 - Methodology & Principles of Virus Study#**Laboratory Detection of Virus**|Lecture 6 - Methodology & Principles of Virus Study]]


#### **Control of Viral Diseases**
**Prevention**
- Sanitation
	- Clean water & food
	- Hygiene
	- Pest control
- Safety
	- Screen Blood Donations for key viruses (HIV, HBV, HCV & <abbr Title="Human T-Lymphotropic Virus">HTLV</abbr>)
	- [[Lecture 6 - Methodology & Principles of Virus Study#**Safety in Virus Study**|Laboratory Safety]]
- Immunoprophylaxis
	- Active Immunity: Vaccination → Stimulate Host Immunity
	- Passive Immunity: Administration of pre-formed antibodies

**Treatment**
- Antiviral Chemotherapy
	- Antivirals: Inhibit Specific Steps in Viral Replication
		- Limited Spectrum
		- Resistance & Toxicity are common
	- Immunomodulators: Modify Host Immunoresponses
		- e.g. IFN-α for Chronic HBV / HCV
