#### **Introduction to Fungi**
**Structure**
- Eukaryotic: True Nucleus
	- Chitin Cell Wall
- Absorptive Heterotrophs
	- Non-photosynthetic Decomposers

**Forms**
- Unicellular (Yeast)
- Multicellular (Molds / Hyphae)
	- Septate / Coenocytic: Presence of Septa between Yeast Cells
	- Vegetative / Reproductive: Function
- Dimorphic
	- Switch between Yeast & Mold depending on temperature / environment
	- Pathogenic in one form

**Reproduction**
- Asexual / Mitosis: For Rapid Dissemination
- Sexual / Meiosis: For Genetic Diversity under Poor Conditions


#### **Fungal Culture & Diagnosis**
**Culture Methods**
- Requirements:
	- Specific media (SDA) & antibiotics
	- Lower temperature (25-30Â°C)
	- Longer incubation (Weeks)
- Might be slow & has contamination risks
