Lecture Notes

- Pharmacogenetics
- Cytochrome P450 on Drug Metabolism

---
#### **Pharmacogenetics**
- Study of Drug Response Difference from Allelic Variation affecting Drug Metabolism, Efficacy & Toxicity
- Combination of:
	- Pharmacokinetics: Study of Drug <abbr Title="Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion">ADME</abbr>
	- Pharmacodynamics: Study of Genetic Variations in Drug Responses


#### **Cytochrome P450 Enzymes on Drug Metabolism**
- Mostly Responsible for Phase I Metabolism (Detoxification)
	- Heme-Containing Proteins in Liver
	- 20 Families with CYP1-3 being the major ones
- Combination of Alleles produce Quantitative Different Phenotypes in Drug Metabolism
	- Poor Metabolizers: Drug Accumulation to Toxic Levels
	- Normal Metabolizers: Steadily in Therapeutic Range
	- Ultrafast Metabolizers: Fails to maintain drug concentration at Therapeutic Range

**Examples**
- Camptothecin: Antitumor Drug as DNA topoisomerase inhibitor
	- UGT1A1: Glucuronate Transferase facilitate Camptothecin excretion in Bile
		- UGT1A1`*`1: 6 TA Repeats in Promoter
		- UGT1A1`*`28: 7 TA Repeats in Promoter → ↓ Transcription → Toxicity
- Warfarin: 
	- VKORC1: Vitamin K Epoxide Reductase Complex I (Warfarin Target)
		- A/G Phenotype
	- CYP2C9: P450 Protein responsible for Warfarin detoxification
		- `*`1/`*`3 Phenotype
