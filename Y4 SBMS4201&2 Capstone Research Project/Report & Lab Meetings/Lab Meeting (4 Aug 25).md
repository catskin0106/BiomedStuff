#### **Gamma-Delta T cells**
- Progenitor T cell divides into 2 lineages after DN2
	- DN3 then develops into CD4+ & CD8+
	- Gamma-Delta T cells

- Gamma-Delta T cells have both Anti- & Pro- Tumor effects
	- Release ILs to promote carcinogenic metabolism & angiogenesis


#### **Genomic Epidemiology to Elucidate Early Onset of Colorectal Cancer**
- Niche: Most Cancer cause studies focus on late cancer
	- Birth-Cohort Effect: Correlate Cancer Risk Factor to Mutation Patterns in Newborns of that Birth Period


#### **Niche-Bearing Tumor**
- Fibroblast contribution to TME for tumor survival, growth & spread
- Methodology:
	- Epithelium + Carcinogen co-culture with Fibroblast
		- Shows increased cancer proliferation rate & fibroblast rearrangement
	- Epithelium


#### **Multi-Omics**
-
