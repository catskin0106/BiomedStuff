#### **Principles of Cell Invasion Assay**
- FBS is present in lower well but absent in the upper trans-well → Attract cells
	- Cells will migrate across Matrigel & through the trans-well pore into the lower well
	- Called Cell Migration Assay if Matrigel is not set

#### **Steps of Cell Invasion Assay**
**1. Matrigel Setting**
- For each trans-well add 50μL DMEM×FBS & 2μL Matrigel
- Incubate 2 hrs 37C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in a 24-well plate

**2. Trypsinization & Cell Counting**
- See [[2.1 - Cancer Cell Culturing, Subculturing & Seeding]]
	- Calculate volume needed to seed 20000 (50000) for each each trans-well

**3. Seeding**
- Retrieve the trans-wells from the incubator
- → Remove excessive liquid on top of gel in trans-wells
- → Add 750μL DMEM×FBS into the lower wells
- Seed cells into the trans-wells:
	- (If volume > 200μL), Centrifuge again and add 200μL pure DMEM
	- (If volume < 200μL), Add the calculated volume and top up with pure DMEM until 200μL

**4. Incubation**
- Put trans-well on lower wells
	- → Incubate 2 hrs 37C 5% CO<sub>2</sub>
