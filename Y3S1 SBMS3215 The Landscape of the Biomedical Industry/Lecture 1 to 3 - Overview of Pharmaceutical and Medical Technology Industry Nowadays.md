#### **Branches of Biomedical Industry**
| Branch         | Description                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Pharmaceutical | Small molecules (synthesized Chemical Drugs)     |
| BioTech        | Big molecules (derived from Biological Entities) |
| MedTech        | Medical Diagnostic Devices                       |
| Healthcare IT  | Digitalization of Healthcare System              |


#### **History of Biomedical Industry**
**History of Pharmacy**
- Ancient: Apothecary
- Now: Pharmaceutical Industry 
	- Facilitated by Scientific Revolution (Rationalism & Experimentation) & Industrial Revolution (Production of Goods)

**History of MedTech**
- Ancient: Prosthetics Development


#### **Types of Medical Products**
- Use in Diagnosis, Mitigation, Cure, Treatment or Prevention of diseases;

**Drugs**
- **Or** Substance other than food that affects body structure & function
	- Some drugs are not related to diseases (Contraceptives)
- Comprised of <abbr Title="Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient">API</abbr> & Excipients
	- API: Drug ingredient that produces desired effect
	- Excipients: Inactive components (Dyes & Flavor)
- Categories:
	- Biologics: Large Molecule Drugs from Biological Sources
	- Biosimilars: Drugs with same mechanism-of-action as reference drug

**Medical Device**
- **And** Medical Product not absorbed or metabolized by body


#### **Major Types of Biotech Companies**
**Major Types of Pharmaceutical Companies**

| Traditional Types                                | Description                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Ethical Pharmaceutical Companies<br>(Big Pharma) | Focus on Numerous & Wide Range of Products → More manufacturing Plants <br>Established Companies → Large R&D Budget |
| Biotechnology Companies                          | Focus on Biologics → Has Novel R&D Platforms<br>Might Need Partners → Collab with Big Pharmas                       |
| Generic Drug Companies                           | Focus on Medication in Lower Price → Favors payees<br>Need to wait for Patent Expiration                            |

**Major Type of MedTech Companies**
- Depends on the category of Medical Devices

| Category  | Risks to Patients | Examples                      |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Class I   | Low               | Gloves & Bandages             |
| Class II  | Moderate          | Wheelchairs & Surgical Drapes |
| Class III | High              | Heart Valves & Organ Implants |

**Basic Structure of Biotech Companies**
- No universal model
- Typically has R&D, Commercial Operations & Regulatory



#### **Roles and Organization of Pharma & MedTech Industry**
- Address Medical & Non-medical needs as forces for social good
	- Self-interest to sustain self unintended act as invisible hand that provides greater social benefit
		- Blockbuster Drugs (1st: Tagamet / Cimetidine)
	- Increases drug accessibility by:

| Stage            | Means                                        | Description                                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| <br><br>Clinical | Clinical Trials                              | Might not be available                                   |
| ^                | Compassionate Use (1 Patient)                | Free of cost but Not enough awareness                    |
| ^                | Named Patient Use (1 Patient)                | Use of drug approved in other countries; No free of cost |
| ^                | Expanded Access Protocol (Multiple Patients) | Allows wider use of drugs in given population            |
| Launch           | Sampling                                     |                                                          |
| Post-Launch      | Drug Assistance Program                      | Barrier (Complex application) & Ethical Issues (Equity)  |
- Advocate for imposing regulations
	- Minimal Regulations
	- Stringent Regulations: FDA Approval & Monitoring Systems
		- Due to Thalidomide Tragedy

**Socioeconomic Factors Behind Healthcare Needs**
- Unmet needs: Existing Products has undesirable Efficacy / Pricing
- Newly arising condition: Changes in Demographics / Economy
- New Diseases & Technologies

**Ways to Identify Healthcare Needs**
- Search Medical Databases (WHO, UN)
- Emergency / Changing Healthcare Threats
- Consultation (Professionals, Marketing Companies)

**Relationship between the Industry and Stakeholders**
