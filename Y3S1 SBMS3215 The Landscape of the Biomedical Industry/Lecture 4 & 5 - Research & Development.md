#### **Pharmaceutical Product Life Cycle**
- R&D → Clinical Trial → Launch → Growth → Maturity → Obsolete

**R&D Life Cycle**

| Stage                   | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Discovery               | Select diseases target → Search and Optimize lead compound<br>- Simulation / in vitro                                  |
| Preclinical Development | Establish initial parameters of safety & efficacy through <br>- In vitro / in vivo studies<br>- Bioavailability & ADME |
| Clinical Development    | Test safety & efficacy in clinical trials<br>- Adhere to reviewer approved protocols & publication guidelines          |

**Clinical Trials**
- Regulating Safety, Efficacy & Consent
	- Example: The Tuskegee Syphilis Study
		- Conducted by US Government on 600 impoverished African Americans on 1932 - 1972
		- Offers 6 months of free treatment for a 40 year trial
- Clinical Trial has many types
	- Case control studies: Control V.S. Experimental
	- Cross sectional studies: Observe defined patient population
	- (Blinded) Randomized Control Trial: Randomized subjects
	- Non-inferiority Trial: Compare product with existing treatment
 
| Phase | Scale    | Duration | Description                                                                                           |
| ----- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | 10-15    |          | Sub-therapeutic Dose:<br>Select Candidate with Best Pharmacokinetics & Pharmacodynamics               |
| I     | 20-100   | Months   | Highest Tolerable Dose:<br>Select Best Administration Route & Identify Side Effects / Safety          |
| II    | 20-100   | <2y      | IIA: Decide on dosage<br>IIB: Observe efficacy of dosage                                              |
| III   | 300-3000 | 1-4y     | IIIA: Drug Approval from Regulatory Agency<br>IIIB: Additional Safety Data & Support Marketing Claims |
| IV    | >1000    | <4y      | Refine / Confirm / Deny Product Safety & Efficacy                                                     |

#### **Risks in R&D**
- Market, Financial, Timing, **Technical (R&D)**, Organizational & Environmental

**Ways to Reduce Risk**
- George Day's R-W-W screen
	-  Reduce risk & Increase success likelihood

| Component          | Description                                                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is it real?        | Is the market / product real?                                                            |
| Can we win?        | Can the product / company be competitive?                                                |
| Is it worth doing? | Is the risk-profit ratio acceptable?<br>Does launching the product make strategic sense? |
- Quadrant Chart
	- Target Product Profile of new product
		- Identifies how and why the potential product is better
	- 2 Dimensions: Safety / Side Effect & Efficacy
- First-in-Class (Novelty V.S. Me-too)
- Identifying Existing Competitors

#### **Drug Discovery Methodologies**
**Target-based Screening**
- Identifies & Validates possible protein target associated with disease of interest
- Pros
	- Lower Cost & Time
	- Known molecular target & structure-activity relationship
	- Easier lead optimization
- Cons
	- Hypothesis-driven → Low translatability

**Phenotypic Screening**
- Test & Filter for compounds that improve disease phenotype without initial concern of protein targets
- Pros
	- Higher Cost & Time
	- Unknown molecular target & structure-activity relationship
	- Harder lead optimization
- Cons
	- Empirical-driven → High translatability

**Computer-Aided Drug Design (CADD)**
- Collects multiple chemical-molecular & quantum strategies
	- Can increase success in screening compound, but needs other kind of screening

**Unconventional Drug Discovery**
-  Serendipity: Warfarin
- Drug reprofiling:
	- Lithium: Bladder stones / gout → Mania
	- Cortisone: High altitude stress → Reduce inflammation
	- Tamoxifen: Anti-fertility → Breast Cancer


#### **Innovative Models for Drug Testing**
- Reduce R&D Cost by higher failure rates & clinical complexity and size

**Microfluidics**
- Micro-scale engineering devices that manipulates fluid flow in channels
- Pros:
	- Miniaturization reduces cost from reagent consumption
	- Versatile Applications 
- Example: Osteochondral Tissue Chip as model to test Celecoxib (COX-2 Inhibitor) in treating Osteoarthritis

**Organoid Culture**
- 3D structure of Organ-Specific Cell Types grown from Stem Cells
	- Spatially restricted lineage commitment & cell sorting → Self Organization
- Pros:
	- Better mimic essential cellular functions only recapitulated in 3D environment
	- Better assess drug dose, combinations on targeted & non-targeted tissues
	- 3D Pharmacokinetics
