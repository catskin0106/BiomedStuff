#### **Distribution of Water & Solutes**
**Distribution of Water**

**Distribution of Ions**

| Compartment | Major Cations  | Major Anions                                |
| ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ECF         | Na<sup>+</sup> | Cl<sup>-</sup>, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> |
| ICF         | K<sup>+</sup>  | P<sub>i</sub> , Organic Anions & Proteins   |
- ECF:ICF Ratio regulation mainly contributed by Na<sup>+</sup> osmotic activity

**Measurement of Particles in Water**
- Number of Particles in Solution: Osmol / mOsmol
	- Non-ionizing substances: 1 mmol = 1 mOsmol
	- Ionizing substances: 1 mmol = 2 mOsmol
- Concentration of Particles in a Solution: Osmolarity & Osmolality
	- Osmolality: Particle Concentration in 1 kg water (mOsmol/kg H<sub>2</sub>O)
	- Osmolarity: Particle Concentration in 1 L water (mOsmol/L H<sub>2</sub>O)


#### **Regulation of Body Osmolality**
**Countercurrent Multiplier System**
- Control of Nephron Osmolality by Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-2Cl<sup>-</sup> cotransporter from Ascending Limb to Interstitial Compartment
	- Ascending Limb: always 200 mOsmol < Interstitial Compartment at same depth (Hypotonic)
	- Descending Limb: Net water flow from Descending Limb to Interstitial Compartment
		- Osmolality keeps increasing until 1200 mOsmol at turning point (Hypertonic)
	- Result: Water exiting Loop of Henle is less hypertonic
		- → Preserve Osmotic Gradient
