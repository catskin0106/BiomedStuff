**Part 1: Gastrointestinal System**

**1. A 15-year-old girl presents to her family doctor with complaints of diarrhea, bloating and gas after consuming milk. The symptoms resolve when she avoids milk products for a 2-week period.**

*   **(a) Name the absorbable forms of monosaccharides. (3 marks)**
    The absorbable forms of monosaccharides are **glucose, fructose, and galactose**. Complex carbohydrates must be broken down into these simple sugars before they can be absorbed by the intestinal epithelium.

*   **(b) What is the most likely diagnosis for this patient? (1 mark)**
    The most likely diagnosis is **Lactose Intolerance**. The timing of symptoms (after consuming milk) and resolution upon avoidance strongly suggest an inability to digest lactose, the primary sugar in milk.

*   **(c) Name the type of diarrhea developed in this girl. (1 mark)**
    The type of diarrhea is **osmotic diarrhea**.

*   **(d) What is the underlying cause of this condition? (5 marks)**
    The underlying cause is a **deficiency or insufficient activity of the enzyme lactase** (also known as lactase-phlorizin hydrolase) in the brush border of the small intestine enterocytes.
    *   Normally, lactase breaks down lactose (a disaccharide) into glucose and galactose, which are then absorbed.
    *   In lactase deficiency, undigested lactose passes into the large intestine.
    *   Bacteria in the colon ferment the lactose, producing gases (like hydrogen, carbon dioxide, methane), which causes **bloating and flatulence**.
    *   The undigested lactose and fermentation products (short-chain fatty acids) are osmotically active, drawing water into the intestinal lumen, leading to **osmotic diarrhea**.

**2. Most gastrointestinal (GI) hormones regulate certain aspects of the GI luminal environment in a feedback mechanism and affect more than one effector. Using cholecystokinin (CCK) as an example, explain how the changes in the luminal environment lead to various effector responses. (10 marks)**

CCK provides an excellent example of feedback regulation originating from the duodenal luminal environment.

*   **Stimulus for Release:** CCK is released from enteroendocrine cells (I cells) in the duodenum and jejunum primarily in response to the presence of **fatty acids (especially long-chain) and amino acids/peptides (products of protein digestion)** entering the duodenum from the stomach. The presence of these digestion products signifies that partially digested food, rich in fats and proteins, needs further processing.
*   **Effector Responses & Feedback:** CCK then acts on multiple target organs to coordinate the digestion and absorption of these nutrients, creating feedback loops:
    1.  **Pancreas:** CCK potently stimulates the acinar cells of the pancreas to secrete large amounts of **pancreatic digestive enzymes** (lipases, proteases like trypsinogen, amylase). *Feedback:* This provides the necessary enzymes to break down the fats and proteins that stimulated CCK release.
    2.  **Gallbladder:** CCK causes strong contraction of the gallbladder and relaxation of the Sphincter of Oddi. *Feedback:* This releases stored **bile** into the duodenum. Bile salts are essential for emulsifying fats, increasing the surface area for pancreatic lipase action, thus aiding the digestion of the fats that stimulated CCK release.
    3.  **Stomach:** CCK **inhibits gastric emptying** (slows down the rate at which chyme leaves the stomach). *Feedback:* This prevents the small intestine from being overwhelmed with too much fat and protein at once, allowing more time for the bile and pancreatic enzymes to act effectively on the existing duodenal contents. This reduces the flow of the stimulus (fats/proteins) into the duodenum.
    4.  **Brain (Satiety):** CCK acts on receptors in the nervous system (including vagal afferents) to promote a feeling of **satiety**. *Feedback:* This signals to the brain that food rich in nutrients has arrived in the intestine, contributing to the termination of eating, thus limiting further intake of the stimulating nutrients.

In summary, the presence of fats and proteins in the duodenum triggers CCK release, which coordinates pancreatic enzyme secretion, bile release, slowed gastric emptying, and satiety – all aimed at efficiently digesting and absorbing those specific nutrients and preventing the system from being overloaded.

**Part 2: Renal System**

**3. Outline how Na⁺ reabsorption in the collecting duct is regulated by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in response to hyponatremia. (10 marks)**

*Note: While RAAS primarily responds to low blood volume/pressure and high K⁺, it also plays a role, albeit complex, in sodium balance. Severe hyponatremia itself isn't the *primary* trigger for RAAS in the way volume depletion is, and other systems (like ADH) dominate in pure water/sodium balance disturbances. However, interpreting the question as asking about RAAS's *mechanism* on the collecting duct's Na+ handling:*

The Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) regulates Na⁺ reabsorption in the **late distal tubule and collecting duct**, primarily through the action of **aldosterone**.

1.  **RAAS Activation (General context, less direct from hyponatremia):** Low blood pressure/volume detected by the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) in the kidneys stimulates **renin** release. Renin converts angiotensinogen (from the liver) to angiotensin I. Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to **angiotensin II (Ang II)**. Ang II stimulates the adrenal cortex to release **aldosterone**. *(Direct stimulation by hyponatremia is weak; severe volume depletion often co-exists which strongly activates RAAS).*
2.  **Aldosterone Action:** Aldosterone is a steroid hormone that travels through the bloodstream and acts on **principal cells** in the collecting duct (and late distal tubule).
3.  **Mechanism:** Aldosterone binds to intracellular mineralocorticoid receptors within the principal cells. This hormone-receptor complex translocates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor.
4.  **Increased Na⁺ Transport Proteins:** Aldosterone signaling leads to:
    *   Increased synthesis and insertion of **epithelial sodium channels (ENaC)** into the apical (luminal) membrane of principal cells.
    *   Increased synthesis and activity of the **Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase pumps** in the basolateral membrane.
    *   Increased activity of mitochondrial enzymes to supply ATP for the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase.
5.  **Result (Na⁺ Reabsorption):** The increased number and activity of ENaC channels allow more Na⁺ to enter the principal cells from the tubular fluid down its electrochemical gradient. The upregulated Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase actively pumps this Na⁺ out of the cell into the interstitial fluid (and then blood), while pumping K⁺ into the cell. This overall process leads to **increased reabsorption of Na⁺** from the collecting duct fluid back into the body.
6.  **Relation to Hyponatremia:** By increasing Na⁺ reabsorption, aldosterone helps to conserve sodium, counteracting sodium loss and potentially mitigating hyponatremia, *especially if the hyponatremia is associated with volume depletion*. However, in cases of hyponatremia due to excess water (like SIADH), the water retention effect often overwhelms the sodium-retaining effect of RAAS.

**4. Describe how filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed by the proximal convoluted tubule and how hydrogen ion is secreted and buffered in the collecting duct. (10 marks)**

*Note: The question asks about bicarbonate reabsorption in PCT *and* H+ secretion/buffering in the collecting duct. These are distinct processes.*

**A. Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) Reabsorption in the Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT):**

Approximately 80-90% of filtered bicarbonate is reabsorbed in the PCT. This is an indirect process crucial for maintaining acid-base balance.

1.  **H⁺ Secretion:** H⁺ ions are actively secreted from the PCT cell into the tubular lumen, primarily via the **Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger (NHE3)** on the apical membrane and also via an H⁺-ATPase.
2.  **Reaction in Lumen:** Secreted H⁺ combines with filtered HCO₃⁻ in the lumen to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃).
    `H⁺ + HCO₃⁻ ⇌ H₂CO₃`
3.  **Carbonic Anhydrase (CA) Action (Apical):** Carbonic anhydrase (CA-IV) located on the apical brush border membrane rapidly catalyzes the breakdown of H₂CO₃ into carbon dioxide (CO₂) and water (H₂O).
    `H₂CO₃ ⇌ CO₂ + H₂O`
4.  **CO₂ Diffusion:** CO₂ is lipid-soluble and readily diffuses across the apical membrane into the PCT cell.
5.  **Reaction in Cell:** Inside the cell, CO₂ combines with H₂O (catalyzed by intracellular carbonic anhydrase, CA-II) to reform H₂CO₃.
    `CO₂ + H₂O ⇌ H₂CO₃`
6.  **Intracellular Dissociation:** H₂CO₃ quickly dissociates into H⁺ and HCO₃⁻ within the cell.
    `H₂CO₃ ⇌ H⁺ + HCO₃⁻`
7.  **HCO₃⁻ Transport (Basolateral):** The newly formed HCO₃⁻ is transported out of the cell across the basolateral membrane into the interstitial fluid (and blood), primarily via a **Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransporter (NBCe1)** and also potentially a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger.
8.  **H⁺ Recycling:** The intracellular H⁺ generated in step 6 is recycled back into the lumen via NHE3 and H⁺-ATPase (step 1) to facilitate further bicarbonate reabsorption.

*Net effect:* For every H⁺ secreted into the lumen that combines with filtered HCO₃⁻, one HCO₃⁻ is effectively returned to the blood.

**B. Hydrogen Ion (H⁺) Secretion and Buffering in the Collecting Duct:**

The collecting duct plays a fine-tuning role in acid excretion.

1.  **H⁺ Secretion:** **α-intercalated cells** in the collecting duct actively secrete H⁺ into the tubular lumen via an **H⁺-ATPase** and an **H⁺/K⁺-ATPase** located on their apical membrane. This process is stimulated by acidosis and aldosterone.
2.  **Buffering:** Since the minimum achievable urine pH is ~4.5, free H⁺ concentration cannot increase indefinitely. Secreted H⁺ must be buffered to allow significant acid excretion. The main urinary buffers are:
    *   **Phosphate Buffer System:** Filtered hydrogen phosphate (HPO₄²⁻) accepts secreted H⁺ to become dihydrogen phosphate (H₂PO₄⁻).
        `HPO₄²⁻ + H⁺ → H₂PO₄⁻`
        This "traps" the H⁺ in the urine as titratable acid.
    *   **Ammonia Buffer System:** PCT cells metabolize glutamine to produce ammonium (NH₄⁺) and new bicarbonate. NH₄⁺ enters the lumen. In the collecting duct, ammonia (NH₃) diffuses from the interstitium into the lumen and combines with secreted H⁺ to form ammonium (NH₄⁺).
        `NH₃ + H⁺ ⇌ NH₄⁺`
        NH₄⁺ is lipid-insoluble and is "trapped" in the urine, facilitating H⁺ excretion. α-intercalated cells also actively secrete NH₄⁺ via transporters substituting for K+.

*Net effect:* Secretion and subsequent buffering of H⁺ in the collecting duct leads to the excretion of net acid (titratable acid + NH₄⁺) and the generation/return of new bicarbonate to the blood.

**Part 3: Endocrine System**

**5. Give an account of the metabolic effects of adrenomedullary secretion of adrenaline in increasing energy supply to the body at the time of stress (e.g. “fight or flight” response). (10 marks)**

The adrenal medulla primarily secretes **adrenaline (epinephrine)**, along with some noradrenaline (norepinephrine), in response to stress signals mediated by the sympathetic nervous system (the "fight or flight" response). Adrenaline rapidly mobilizes energy stores to prepare the body for immediate action:

1.  **Carbohydrate Metabolism:**
    *   **Liver:** Adrenaline strongly stimulates **glycogenolysis** (breakdown of stored glycogen) and **gluconeogenesis** (synthesis of new glucose from non-carbohydrate sources like amino acids and lactate). This rapidly increases the release of glucose from the liver into the bloodstream, raising blood glucose levels to supply fuel for the brain and active tissues.
    *   **Skeletal Muscle:** Adrenaline also stimulates **glycogenolysis** in muscle. However, muscle lacks the enzyme glucose-6-phosphatase, so the glucose-6-phosphate produced is primarily used *within the muscle itself* for glycolysis to generate ATP quickly for muscle contraction. It also releases lactate, which can be used by the liver for gluconeogenesis.
    *   **Pancreas:** Adrenaline inhibits insulin secretion and stimulates glucagon secretion, further promoting hyperglycemia.
2.  **Fat Metabolism:**
    *   **Adipose Tissue:** Adrenaline activates **hormone-sensitive lipase**, stimulating **lipolysis** (breakdown of stored triglycerides). This releases **free fatty acids (FFAs)** and glycerol into the bloodstream. FFAs become a major energy source for many tissues (like muscle and heart), sparing glucose for the brain. Glycerol can be used by the liver for gluconeogenesis.
3.  **Overall Metabolic Rate:** Adrenaline can increase the overall metabolic rate of cells (calorigenic effect), increasing oxygen consumption and heat production, further supporting a state of heightened activity.

In summary, adrenaline rapidly increases the availability of readily usable energy sources (glucose and free fatty acids) in the circulation by breaking down storage forms (glycogen and triglycerides) in the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue, ensuring ample fuel supply for the brain and muscles during the stress response.

**6. Use a named example of a pituitary hormone to describe the organization of a neuroendocrine reflex and its components. Discuss the significance of neuroendocrine control. (10 marks)**

**Example: Oxytocin and the Milk Ejection (Let-Down) Reflex**

*   **Organization and Components:** This is a classic neuroendocrine reflex involving the posterior pituitary.
    1.  **Stimulus:** Physical stimulation of mechanoreceptors in the nipple by the suckling infant.
    2.  **Afferent Pathway:** Sensory neurons transmit signals from the nipple via the spinal cord to the hypothalamus.
    3.  **Integrating Center:** Neurons in specific hypothalamic nuclei (**paraventricular nucleus, PVN, and supraoptic nucleus, SON**) process the afferent signals.
    4.  **Efferent Pathway (Neural Part):** Action potentials are generated in the magnocellular neurosecretory cells originating in the PVN and SON. These axons travel down the pituitary stalk to terminate in the **posterior pituitary**.
    5.  **Neurosecretion:** Action potentials arriving at the axon terminals in the posterior pituitary cause the release of the stored peptide hormone **oxytocin** into the systemic circulation (capillary network).
    6.  **Hormone Transport:** Oxytocin travels via the bloodstream to target tissues.
    7.  **Target Organ & Effector Response:** Oxytocin binds to receptors on **myoepithelial cells** surrounding the alveoli and ducts of the mammary gland, causing them to contract and eject milk ("milk let-down").
*   **Significance of Neuroendocrine Control:**
    *   **Interface between Nervous and Endocrine Systems:** Neuroendocrine reflexes allow the nervous system (which rapidly processes sensory information and internal states) to exert control over widespread physiological processes via hormones released into the bloodstream.
    *   **Coordination:** Enables coordinated responses involving multiple target tissues (e.g., oxytocin also causes uterine contractions).
    *   **Amplification:** A neural signal can trigger the release of hormones that circulate widely and can affect many cells simultaneously, amplifying the initial signal.
    *   **Temporal Control:** Allows for hormonal responses that can be relatively rapid (like milk ejection) or sustained, depending on the nature of the stimulus and hormone characteristics.
    *   **Integration:** Allows the brain (hypothalamus) to integrate various inputs (sensory, emotional, circadian) to modulate hormone release appropriate to the organism's overall state and environmental demands.

**Part 4: Reproductive System**

**7. Mrs. Hui has had an uneventful pregnancy, with regular antenatal visits and no complications reported. Her pregnancy is at 32 weeks of gestation. She recently presents to the antenatal clinic with complaints of persistent swelling in her hands and face for the past week. She also reports experiencing severe headache and intermittent blurred vision. On examination, Mrs. Hui’s blood pressure is measured at 150/100 mmHg (elevated), with a baseline blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg at her earlier visits. She has generalized edema, particularly in her hands and face. Laboratory investigations reveal proteinuria.**

*   **(a) Based on the symptoms and findings, what is the diagnosis for Mrs. Hui? (2 marks)**
    The diagnosis is **Preeclampsia**. This is characterized by the new onset of hypertension (≥140/90 mmHg after 20 weeks gestation in previously normotensive woman) accompanied by proteinuria or other signs of end-organ dysfunction (in this case, headache and blurred vision suggest neurological involvement, and edema is common though not diagnostic).

*   **(b) Name one complication associated with the severe case of Mrs. Hui’s diagnosis. (1 mark)**
    One major severe complication is **Eclampsia** (the occurrence of generalized seizures in a woman with preeclampsia). Other severe complications include HELLP syndrome (Hemolysis, Elevated Liver enzymes, Low Platelets), placental abruption, acute kidney injury, pulmonary edema, or stroke.

*   **(c) Explain the pathophysiology of Mrs. Hui’s condition by comparing a healthy pregnancy. (7 marks)**
    *   **Healthy Pregnancy:** During normal pregnancy, placental trophoblast cells invade the maternal spiral arteries in the uterus. This invasion remodels the arteries, destroying their muscular walls and converting them into wide, low-resistance vessels. This ensures adequate blood flow (~500-750 ml/min) to the placenta to meet the growing fetal demands. Maternal systemic vascular resistance typically decreases, and blood pressure may slightly fall in mid-pregnancy.
    *   **Preeclampsia Pathophysiology:** In preeclampsia, this **trophoblast invasion is incomplete or shallow**. The spiral arteries fail to remodel adequately and remain narrow, high-resistance vessels. This leads to **placental hypoperfusion, hypoxia, and ischemia**.
    *   The ischemic placenta releases various factors (e.g., anti-angiogenic factors like sFlt-1, sEng; inflammatory mediators) into the maternal circulation.
    *   These factors cause widespread **maternal systemic endothelial dysfunction**.
    *   Endothelial dysfunction results in:
        *   **Vasoconstriction** and increased vascular reactivity → **Hypertension**.
        *   Increased **vascular permeability** → Leakage of protein into urine (**proteinuria**) and fluid into tissues (**edema**).
        *   Activation of the coagulation system (potential for thrombosis).
        *   End-organ damage due to poor perfusion and endothelial injury (e.g., causing **headache/blurred vision** due to cerebral vasospasm/edema, liver enzyme elevation, kidney dysfunction).

**8. What are the sources of estrogen in non-pregnant women? (3 marks) Explain the effects of estrogen on the endometrial lining and the hypothalamus during the follicular phase, ovulation, and luteal phase. (7 marks)**

*   **Sources of Estrogen in Non-Pregnant Women:**
    1.  **Ovaries (Primary Source):** Developing **ovarian follicles**, specifically the **granulosa cells**, are the main source. They convert androgens (produced by theca cells under LH stimulation) into estrogens (mainly estradiol) via the enzyme aromatase, stimulated by FSH. The corpus luteum also produces some estrogen.
    2.  **Adrenal Glands:** Produce weak androgens which can be converted to estrogen.
    3.  **Peripheral Tissues (e.g., Adipose Tissue):** Can convert adrenal and ovarian androgens into estrogen (peripheral aromatization). This becomes the main source after menopause.
*   **Effects of Estrogen on Endometrial Lining and Hypothalamus:**
    *   **Follicular Phase:**
        *   *Endometrium:* Rising estrogen levels stimulate the proliferation and thickening of the functionalis layer of the endometrium (the **proliferative phase**), increasing gland and blood vessel growth.
        *   *Hypothalamus:* Initially (early/mid-follicular phase), moderate estrogen levels exert **negative feedback** on the hypothalamus (and pituitary), suppressing GnRH, LH, and FSH release. As the dominant follicle matures and produces very high levels of estrogen (late follicular phase), this switches to **positive feedback** on the hypothalamus/pituitary.
    *   **Ovulation:**
        *   *Endometrium:* Estrogen continues to support the proliferative endometrium.
        *   *Hypothalamus:* The sustained high estrogen levels trigger the positive feedback mechanism, leading to a surge release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, which in turn causes the **LH surge** from the pituitary, triggering ovulation.
    *   **Luteal Phase:**
        *   *Endometrium:* Estrogen, produced by the corpus luteum (along with dominant progesterone), helps maintain the thickened endometrium and supports the development of secretory characteristics initiated by progesterone.
        *   *Hypothalamus:* Estrogen, in combination with progesterone from the corpus luteum, exerts strong **negative feedback** on the hypothalamus (and pituitary), suppressing GnRH, LH, and FSH release, preventing new follicle development during this phase.
